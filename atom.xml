How to Choose Bedtime Stories for Kids"></a>Part II. How to Choose Bedtime Stories for Kids</h2><p>Like with music, some bedtime videos are better for relaxation, while others are better for fun. Good bedtime story videos will relax your child, aid in their wind-down, and help them get ready for bed. They calm racing thoughts and aid in acclimatizing young bodies and brains to a peaceful night.</p><h3 id="Essential-Elements-of-An-Effective-Bedtime-Story-Video"><a href="#Essential-Elements-of-An-Effective-Bedtime-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Essential Elements of An Effective Bedtime Story Video"></a>Essential Elements of An Effective Bedtime Story Video</h3><p>Here are the elements of an effective bedtime story video.</p><p><strong>1. Plot</strong></p><p>One of the story’s most essential aspects is the plot. It propels the story’s action and aids in presenting the events’ logical progression as you guide your central character toward the intended happy ending or catastrophic finish. A simple plot’s structure is its core. Even a short story can have a beginning, middle, and end that are all delineated. A more complex plot, however, will contain a few extra pieces.</p><ul><li><strong>Exposition</strong></li></ul><p>The exposition sets the scene for the conflict or narrative driver at the story’s start by introducing the cast of characters.</p><ul><li><strong>Rising Action</strong></li></ul><p>A struggle that sets the setting for the plot to unfold will be created early on by a sequence of events and an igniting occurrence.</p><ul><li><strong>Climax</strong></li></ul><p>The part of the narrative where the tension is raised frequently caps off at the turning point.</p><ul><li><strong>Falling action</strong></li></ul><p>The subplots are resolved here as the drama advances from its thrilling finale to its resolution and conclusion.</p><ul><li><strong>Denouement</strong></li></ul><p>The part of the story where everything is resolved and all loose ends are tied.</p><p><strong>2. Music</strong></p><p>The soporific effects of watching bedtime stories set to music in three-act patterns are enhanced. In their dreams, people often have three acts. These structures frequently need more apparent segmentation and boundary lines. The idea of a beginning, middle, and the ending is helped by adding music. Music alters how bedtime story videos are communicated to the audience’s brains. It intensifies the feeling and can be utilized to highlight the three-act framework even though it is not overtly included in the plot. Imagine having a dream that is structured like a three-act play. It is the ideal sleeping pattern.</p><h3 id="DIY-Your-Own-Heart-warming-Bedtime-Stories-for-Your-Kids"><a href="#DIY-Your-Own-Heart-warming-Bedtime-Stories-for-Your-Kids" class="headerlink" title="DIY Your Own Heart-warming Bedtime Stories for Your Kids"></a>DIY Your Own Heart-warming Bedtime Stories for Your Kids</h3><p>The availability of applications like Filmora makes employing them to produce bedtime story videos a clear advantage.

[Animated] My No No No Day by Rebecca Patterson (38,488,808 views)"></a>8. [Animated] My No No No Day by Rebecca Patterson (38,488,808 views)</h3><p>The animated story <strong><em>My No No No Day</em></strong> by Rebecca Patterson tells the tale of Bella, a little child, and her “no no no” day. It addresses feelings, connections, and obligations to other people. Muted and pastel colors are used in the vibrant and intricate artwork, which makes the stocky brunette Bella stand out in her red dress and sandals.</p><p>In particular, Patterson is skilled at capturing Bella’s emotional condition through her dramatic stance as she raises her hands in disobedience, clenches her fists in annoyance, or falls to the ground in a rage. At the same time, her eyes squint sulkily, and her mouth is open constantly in loud verbal protest.</p><p><strong>Featured Review</strong></p><p><strong><em>“I think everybody has No No No days, and I love that this little girl realized she had been onery, apologized, and the mom freely forgave her!

How to Choose Bedtime Stories for Kids"></a>Part II. How to Choose Bedtime Stories for Kids</h2><p>Like with music, some bedtime videos are better for relaxation, while others are better for fun. Good bedtime story videos will relax your child, aid in their wind-down, and help them get ready for bed. They calm racing thoughts and aid in acclimatizing young bodies and brains to a peaceful night.</p><h3 id="Essential-Elements-of-An-Effective-Bedtime-Story-Video-1"><a href="#Essential-Elements-of-An-Effective-Bedtime-Story-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Essential Elements of An Effective Bedtime Story Video"></a>Essential Elements of An Effective Bedtime Story Video</h3><p>Here are the elements of an effective bedtime story video.</p><p><strong>1. Plot</strong></p><p>One of the story’s most essential aspects is the plot. It propels the story’s action and aids in presenting the events’ logical progression as you guide your central character toward the intended happy ending or catastrophic finish. A simple plot’s structure is its core. Even a short story can have a beginning, middle, and end that are all delineated. A more complex plot, however, will contain a few extra pieces.</p><ul><li><strong>Exposition</strong></li></ul><p>The exposition sets the scene for the conflict or narrative driver at the story’s start by introducing the cast of characters.</p><ul><li><strong>Rising Action</strong></li></ul><p>A struggle that sets the setting for the plot to unfold will be created early on by a sequence of events and an igniting occurrence.</p><ul><li><strong>Climax</strong></li></ul><p>The part of the narrative where the tension is raised frequently caps off at the turning point.</p><ul><li><strong>Falling action</strong></li></ul><p>The subplots are resolved here as the drama advances from its thrilling finale to its resolution and conclusion.</p><ul><li><strong>Denouement</strong></li></ul><p>The part of the story where everything is resolved and all loose ends are tied.</p><p><strong>2. Music</strong></p><p>The soporific effects of watching bedtime stories set to music in three-act patterns are enhanced. In their dreams, people often have three acts. These structures frequently need more apparent segmentation and boundary lines. The idea of a beginning, middle, and the ending is helped by adding music. Music alters how bedtime story videos are communicated to the audience’s brains. It intensifies the feeling and can be utilized to highlight the three-act framework even though it is not overtly included in the plot. Imagine having a dream that is structured like a three-act play. It is the ideal sleeping pattern.</p><h3 id="DIY-Your-Own-Heart-warming-Bedtime-Stories-for-Your-Kids-1"><a href="#DIY-Your-Own-Heart-warming-Bedtime-Stories-for-Your-Kids-1" class="headerlink" title="DIY Your Own Heart-warming Bedtime Stories for Your Kids"></a>DIY Your Own Heart-warming Bedtime Stories for Your Kids</h3><p>The availability of applications like Filmora makes employing them to produce bedtime story videos a clear advantage.

A fun, knowledgeable, Beauty Guru can amass a lot of subscribers, become part of a community of other Beauty Gurus, and sometimes even get paid work. The best Beauty Gurus make a variety of different videos instead of takes on the same thing every week. This article will explain six of the most popular video ideas for YouTube Beauty Gurus.</p><h2 id="Video-Ideas-for-Beauty-Gurus-1"><a href="#Video-Ideas-for-Beauty-Gurus-1" class="headerlink" title="Video Ideas for Beauty Gurus"></a>Video Ideas for Beauty Gurus</h2><h4 id="1-Product-Reviews-and-Tutorials"><a href="#1-Product-Reviews-and-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="1. Product Reviews and Tutorials"></a>1. Product Reviews and Tutorials</h4><p> A lot of the beauty videos on YouTube feature products, like different types or brands of makeup. Sometimes these videos are reviews where the Beauty Guru explains why they do or do not like a product. These reviews should be about more than whether you like a color (although there is no harm in mentioning that). Think of the questions your viewers might have about products, such as whether they are easy to put on and how long they last for. Tutorials are less about whether you like a product and more about how to use it properly, although most tutorials you do will probably be for products you like.</p><p> Beauty Gurus who start to gain some popularity are sometimes approached by companies about reviews or sponsorships. It is not uncommon for a company to give away free products for Gurus to review, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with accepting these and then reviewing them honestly. You should never let a company pay you for a good review, though. If products could buy their ways into your good graces then your subscribers would not be able to trust you.</p><p> Accepting sponsorship is not the same as being paid for a good review. If a brand sponsors you then you just need to be upfront about it and let your subscribers know. They may, understandably, not put much stock as your positive reviews of your brand’s products or your negative reviews of their competitors. That’s fine. Focus on tutorials and other types of videos. If you are popular enough that a company decided to approach you then your channel must be big enough to survive losing the few subscribers who will not like the idea of you being sponsored.</p><h4 id="2-‘Look’-Tutorials"><a href="#2-‘Look’-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="2. ‘Look’ Tutorials"></a>2. ‘Look’ Tutorials</h4><p> Do you think you could recreate the red-carpet makeup or hairstyle of a popular celebrity? If you can then that is a great video idea, and you will have as many of these ideas as there are celebrities whose looks you can duplicate. These are the kinds of videos that a lot of viewers on YouTube find interesting. You do not even need to choose real people all of the time. Think about your audience and what kinds of media they might be interested in. Teaching them how to get the same look as a fictional tv or movie character could be a big hit.</p><h4 id="3-Style-by-Occasion"><a href="#3-Style-by-Occasion" class="headerlink" title="3. Style by Occasion"></a>3. Style by Occasion</h4><p> When you know there is a holiday or special occasion coming up then you might want to get a themed video out ahead of it. Showing your subscribers nice styles for a New Year’s Party, or Thanksgiving with the family, can go over really well. These ‘style’ videos do not need to be focused only on seasonal occasions.</p><p> The occasion you teach your subscribers how to dress, do makeup, or style their hair for might be something like school or work. Tips that help people look their best on a daily basis will not only be useful to your subscribers they will show people that beauty is an everyday passion of yours, not just an occasional one. Besides, people are going to be curious about how you usually style yourself.</p><h4 id="4-Favorite-Things"><a href="#4-Favorite-Things" class="headerlink" title="4. Favorite Things"></a>4. Favorite Things</h4><p> People are going to subscribe to you because they think you are knowledgeable, have good taste, and are fun to watch. ‘Favorite Things’ videos demonstrate all of these things. By showing people your favorite products you show them that you know what is out there and what is good. It is also a window into your personal taste. As to being fun to watch; these videos are all about you and what you like. They are a great opportunity to show off your personality.</p><h4 id="5-Problem-Solving"><a href="#5-Problem-Solving" class="headerlink" title="5. Problem Solving"></a>5. Problem Solving</h4><p> You can make videos that will solve real problems your subscribers might have. For example, you can make videos where you teach your subscribers how to manage acne or get stains out of clothes. As people start trusting you as their source of beauty information they may even start asking you questions about problems like these. If you start getting requests for help and do not know how to answer you should do the research and then make a video rather than ignoring the question. Your subscribers will like to see that you care.</p><h4 id="6-Hauls"><a href="#6-Hauls" class="headerlink" title="6. Hauls"></a>6. Hauls</h4><p> After shopping trips you can make quick videos where you show what you bought. This will give your viewers a good idea of your fashion sense. It is also a great way to build up anticipation about what kinds of reviews or tutorials you might have coming up. Haul videos are easy because you do not need to put a lot of planning into them, or even make an outline. You just sit in front of your camera with your shopping bags and start unpacking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-cheerful-footage-extractor-analysis/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Cheerful Footage Extractor Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-fresh-discussion-ideas-for-podcast-success/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Fresh Discussion Ideas for Podcast Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-bringing-history-forward-digitizing-old-photographs-into-video-for-2024/"><u>[New] Bringing History Forward  Digitizing Old Photographs Into Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-canvas-beats-the-art-of-cropping-and-editing-video-sound-for-2024/"><u>[New] Canvas Beats  The Art of Cropping and Editing Video Sound for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-from-concept-to-completion-producing-a-viral-facebook-reel/"><u>[New] From Concept to Completion  Producing a Viral Facebook Reel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-hack-the-art-world-essential-free-3d-psd-files/"><u>[New] Hack the Art World  Essential Free 3D PSD Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-game-streaming-software-you-should-know/"><u>[New] In 2024, Best Game Streaming Software You Should Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elite-index-of-public-domain-picture-sources/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elite Index of Public Domain Picture Sources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-video-top-10-camcorders-reviewed/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Video -

If you want to create stunning text effects or animations, you have to use the basic effect types and elements to accomplish the goal. Therefore, you should first know about the different text and title effect types available in After Effects, and thereafter, you can use those types to create something amazing.</p><p>Along with After Effects source text effect types, we have illustrated how you can use them as well as edit the effect presets minutely to come up with stunning effects and animations. If you are not a big fan of After Effects, we have also stated an alternative way where you get unlimited text effects and animation and you can add and edit text effects in simple steps.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">3D Text</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Rotation and Anchor Point</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Scale and Position</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Blur and Opacity</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Fill and Stroke</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Skew</a></li><li><a href="#part1-7">Tracking</a></li><li><a href="#part1-8">Keyframe</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Edit Text Effects in Videos with AE</a></li><li><a href="#part3">AE Alternative to Edit Text Effects in Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Related FAQs of Title Effects in After Effects</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-8-Popular-Text-Title-Effects-Types-in-AE"><a href="#Part-1-8-Popular-Text-Title-Effects-Types-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 8 Popular Text Title Effects Types in AE"></a>Part 1. 8 Popular Text Title Effects Types in AE</h2><p>There are certain properties and parameters associated with text effects and animations in After Effects. You need to get a complete overview of these types so that you can adjust them and come up with stunning text animations in After Effects.</p><h3 id="1-3D-Text"><a href="#1-3D-Text" class="headerlink" title="1. 3D Text"></a>1. 3D Text</h3><p>Generally, when you type a text in After Effects, by default, it comes out to be two-dimensional. All the associated properties have X and Y axis only. However, if you are planning to create 3D text and title, you need to have Z axis.</p><p>After Effects has “Enable per-character 3D” property to all Z axis to applicable properties so that you can get the desired effect. You can go to properties like rotation or position to find Z axis that you can modify and get the perfect 3D text.</p><h3 id="2-Rotation-and-Anchor-Point"><a href="#2-Rotation-and-Anchor-Point" class="headerlink" title="2. Rotation and Anchor Point"></a>2. Rotation and Anchor Point</h3><p>Rotation is one of the most commonly used parameters in text animations. There are unlimited variations of text animations and effects that you can create using rotation parameter in After Effects. The rotation takes place in proportion to the anchor points of the text. When you change the value of Rotation parameter, the actual rotation takes place around the anchor points.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

Scale and Position"></a>3. Scale and Position</h3><p>If you want to zoom in and zoom out animation for your text or title, you can use the Scale property in After Effects. You can use keyframes and for each keyframe, you can adjust the scale value and create an illustration of zooming in and out very easily.</p><p>There are different variations of zoom in and out effect that you can try on your text and title to make animation creative and visually appealing.

Fill and Stroke"></a>5. Fill and Stroke</h3><p>When it comes to text formatting in animation, fill color and stroke color play a major role. You can change the fill of the text so that the text animation is about changing color randomly. There are different options available for fill color such as RGB, Hue, Saturation, and likewise.</p><p>Similarly, the stroke color can be changed and you can create an animation with changing outline color. At the same time, you can adjust the stroke width to make the text look thick or thin as per your animation requirements.</p><h3 id="6-Skew"><a href="#6-Skew" class="headerlink" title="6. Skew"></a>6. Skew</h3><p>If you want your text to be distorted and unusual, the skew parameter is there for you in After Effects. Skew means the character will not stay parallel and at right angles.

Tracking</h3><p>Tracking refers to the spacing between the characters in a word for a text. You must have seen so many different types of text animations where the spacing between the characters is changing.

Certainly, it is tough, maybe terrible even, to make someone look cool while having a VR headset on their head. But with the design of 360 VR, it is quite sure that engineers have made no attempt to resolve this issue. The headset sports a look similar to what common in the 1980s imagined a futuristic invention would look like. It actually looks like a product with a low-cost, NHS-prescribed article for modifying poor vision.</p><h3 id="Accessories-of-LG-360-VR"><a href="#Accessories-of-LG-360-VR" class="headerlink" title="Accessories of LG 360 VR"></a>Accessories of LG 360 VR</h3><p> Since it is connected via USB Type-C connector, so the company provides it with the package.

It comes in a simple box will all the accessories in it. It is okay to say that the packaging is safe, but should be dealt with care, in the end, it is a delicate product.

We know that the G5 is one of the most influential smartphones present in the market, including an Adreno 530 GPU, Snapdragon 820 and a 4GB RAM. Unfortunately, the first experience with the 360 VR’s performance is unsatisfactory to say the minimum. Having a 920 x 720 resolution per eye, this headset provides a much lower resolution rate as compared to all other virtual reality headsets present in the market. Although using it is a rollercoaster ride through various mixed experiences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-features-of-the-LG-360-VR-headset"><a href="#Key-features-of-the-LG-360-VR-headset" class="headerlink" title="Key features of the LG 360 VR headset"></a>Key features of the LG 360 VR headset</h2><ul><li>It has 1.88 inches IPS LCD display.</li><li>The PPE resolution is 920 x 720.</li><li>The PPI is 639.</li><li>It consists of adjustable lenses.</li><li>It has field-of-view of 80 degrees.</li><li>It is connected via USB Type-C.</li><li>A headphone jack of 3.5mm</li><li>A 6-axis proximity sensor is also present.</li><li>It weighs 116g</li><li>It’s an LG product.</li><li>Price is $220 approx.</li></ul><h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><ul><li>It can be a good option if you are using LG G5.</li><li>It can be something than nothing.</li><li>It can be a good gift to someone you don’t like.</li></ul><h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><ul><li>Its design is very poor.</li><li>It does not work properly</li><li>It is uncomfortable to wear</li><li>It is very expensive as compared to other headsets.</li><li>It also does not have any special apps to install</li><li>You can not experience the VR properly.</li></ul><h3 id="Comparison-of-Samsung-Gear-VR-and-LG-360-VR"><a href="#Comparison-of-Samsung-Gear-VR-and-LG-360-VR" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of Samsung Gear VR and LG 360 VR"></a>Comparison of Samsung Gear VR and LG 360 VR</h3><p>| |  LG 360 VR  | Samsung Gear VR                         |                                                                         |<br>| ————- | ————————————— | ———————————————————————– |<br>| Connection    | Via a USB-C cable                       | Via a Micro-USB connector                                               |<br>| Dimensions    | 164.1x185.6x45.9mm with arms protracted | 92.6x201.9x116.4 mm                                                     |<br>| Weight        | 134.4g                                  | 318g, 171g with phone                                                   |<br>| Compatibility | Works with LG G5                        | Works with Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, Note 5, S7 and S7 Edge |<br>| Resolution    | 960x720 pixels at 693ppi                | 1,280x1,440 pixels, at 518-577ppi also depends on phone                 |</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="More-about-LG-360-VR-headset"><a href="#More-about-LG-360-VR-headset" class="headerlink" title="More about LG 360 VR headset"></a>More about LG 360 VR headset</h3><p> LG 360 VR is a virtual reality device designed by LG. It was actually released with LG G5 and used to promote this phone. LG 360 VR has an internal built-in display, unlike the Gear VR designed by Samsung, which also provides a unit plugging for power directly to the phone. The headset can be controlled from the smartphone screen by just tapping and swiping. LG, however, designed this device to enjoy the virtual reality experience, but the device is not up to the mark. If you haven’t bought this device yet, it is highly advised not to buy this one. It is not a very good design and its performance is also not very good.</p><p> However, with a cost of around $200 to $220, LG 360 VR is a very expensive device with a doubly cost of Samsung Gear VR. In addition to that, it only is compatible with LG G5. Now, it was better if, with this price and compatibility of just one, 360 VR provided a better experience, but it is not a good device to use.</p><p> In crux, LG’s this device isn’t somewhat you’d want to attire in public, and when you ponder that one of the assistances of a mobile headset is that you are not tied to a luxurious gaming rig, LG certainly should have put in some more energy when it comes to the design of 360 VR. If we are going to turn out to be a realm of VR zombies with headsets continually tied to our skulls, then we would probably want those units which let us live in style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-integrate-free-audio-in-your-videos-effortlessly/"><u>[New] In 2024, Integrate FREE Audio in Your Videos Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamlining-social-interaction-via-multi-view-broadcasting-in-facebook/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamlining Social Interaction via Multi-View Broadcasting in Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-storage-capacity-64gb-vs-128gb-for-video-files-for-2024/"><u>[New] Storage Capacity  64GB vs 128GB for Video Files for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-crafting-impressive-instagram-loops/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Guide to Crafting Impressive Instagram Loops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-building-dynamic-youtube-music-chains-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Building Dynamic YouTube Music Chains for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-meme-design-excellence-guide/"><u>[Updated] Meme Design Excellence Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-unveiling-the-path-starting-with-your-youtube-identity-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Path  Starting with Your YouTube Identity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-list-editors-for-android-pics/"><u>2024 Approved  A-List Editors for Android Pics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-youtube-conversion-mastery-top-10-strategies-revealed/"><u>2024 Approved  YouTube Conversion Mastery  Top 10 Strategies Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-5-viral-video-marketing-techniques-for-big-sellers/"><u>2024 Approved Best 5 Viral Video Marketing Techniques For Big Sellers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-approach-to-pinpointing-stellar-photos-on-pexels/"><u>A Step-by-Step Approach to Pinpointing Stellar Photos on Pexels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/advanced-computers-at-your-fingertips/"><u>Advanced Computers at Your Fingertips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/aesthetic-fusion-studio-ultimate-photo-alchemy/"><u>Aesthetic Fusion Studio  Ultimate Photo Alchemy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/affordable-full-hd-cameras-for-stunts-and-sports/"><u>Affordable Full HD Cameras for Stunts and Sports</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/an-insiders-guide-to-flawlessly-integrating-tracks-on-youtube/"><u>An Insider's Guide to Flawlessly Integrating Tracks on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/androidiphone-mastery-discover-the-ultimate-top-8-app-set/"><u>Android/iPhone Mastery  Discover the Ultimate Top 8 App Set</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/androidiphones-ultimate-arvr-game-list/"><u>Android/iPhone's Ultimate AR/VR Game List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/apple-macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-which-m1-laptop-is-better-in-2024/"><u>Apple MacBook Air Vs.

There are different cases for your camera depending on the water contact that you expect your device to encounter. The Dive housing case is an extra protective waterproofing solution for deep-water adventures like scuba diving.</p><h4 id="2-Prevent-fog-inserts"><a href="#2-Prevent-fog-inserts" class="headerlink" title="2.Prevent fog inserts"></a>2.Prevent fog inserts</h4><p>Fogging on the lenses occur due to the condensation of moisture inside the camera. You can either employ some DIY method or place some anti-fog inserts inside the camera casing from all sides. This will completely absorb the moisture in the camera making it ready for shooting. Without removing the fog, you will not be able to shoot crystal clear videos as per desire.</p><h4 id="3-Use-LCD-Touch-BacPac"><a href="#3-Use-LCD-Touch-BacPac" class="headerlink" title="3.Use LCD Touch BacPac"></a>3.Use LCD Touch BacPac</h4><p>You will not be able to operate the touchscreen to adjust the settings under the water. You can adjust the jump settings on the touchscreen before placing the camera into the waterproof housing. Using the LCD Touch BacPac is one of the very essential GoPro underwater tips for framing and controlling different shots. Always remember to avoid using the skeleton door or the touch door provided with the LCD Touch BacPac as it can utterly lead to flow of water inside the camera ruining the device.</p><h4 id="4-Use-the-Filter-for-Deep-Water-Diving"><a href="#4-Use-the-Filter-for-Deep-Water-Diving" class="headerlink" title="4.

For shooting in shallow water with the depth less than 30 feet under the water, you do not need a filter. The divers going beyond the depth of 30 feet should use the DEEP Flip 3.1 Filter for capturing best quality video.</p><h4 id="5-Choose-the-Right-Mounting-Support"><a href="#5-Choose-the-Right-Mounting-Support" class="headerlink" title="5.Choose the Right Mounting Support"></a>5.Choose the Right <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Mounting Support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>It is not possible to hold your GoPro with hands during underwater diving. Using the proper mount will help to keep the hands free while diving and take photos without any shakes or other interruptions.</p><p>There are various types of mounting accessories to choose depending on your convenience and requirement. You can use a selfie stick or a camera rig or similar mount support. The divers using the GoPro Reach can choose the Octamask Diving Scuba Mask to capture best photography underwater. The position of the camera taking the video will be from the head so you can shoot everything you see right away. If you want to capture everything below, the chest mount is a great option.</p><h4 id="6-Adjust-the-Resolution-Settings"><a href="#6-Adjust-the-Resolution-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.Adjust the Resolution Settings"></a>6.Adjust the Resolution Settings</h4><p>The default resolution settings in most GoPro cameras is 1080p, field of view is wide and framerate as 60fps. This is a standard setting to follow if you are novice diver looking to capture high-resolution videos. However, the experienced divers can experiment with faster or slower framerate settings to control the motion of the video as per desire. Skilled photographers often shoot with 4k resolution to ease the processing during zoom, cropping etc.</p><h4 id="During-Underwater-Video-Shooting"><a href="#During-Underwater-Video-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="During Underwater Video Shooting"></a>During Underwater Video Shooting</h4><h4 id="1-Shoot-Videos-in-Shallow-Water-to-Capture-the-Finest-Color-Effect"><a href="#1-Shoot-Videos-in-Shallow-Water-to-Capture-the-Finest-Color-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1.Shoot Videos in Shallow Water to Capture the Finest Color Effect"></a>1.Shoot Videos in Shallow Water to Capture the Finest Color Effect</h4><p>During snorkeling or diving, if swim across the shallow reefs preferably within the 5m deep underwater, you will be able to capture the full spectrum colors without using flash.</p><h4 id="2-Shoot-under-the-Bright-Sunlight-for-Enhanced-Video-Quality"><a href="#2-Shoot-under-the-Bright-Sunlight-for-Enhanced-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discovering-the-Secrets-of-Snapchat’s-Spotlight"><a href="#Discovering-the-Secrets-of-Snapchat’s-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Discovering the Secrets of Snapchat’s Spotlight"></a>Discovering the Secrets of Snapchat’s Spotlight</h2><p>Snapchat is one of the most popular instant messaging apps. The key feature that makes it different from other messaging apps is that users can send text messages, pictures, and short videos that disappear after they are viewed.</p><p>Over the years, Snapchat has introduced various features that elevated its status from being an instant messaging app to a social media platform. In November 2020, Snapchat rolled out a new feature called Spotlight that has become a massive hit among users.</p><p>The Spotlight feature aims to make Snapchat compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. As you may have guessed now, Spotlight is a collection of the most entertaining videos posted by app users.</p><p>Whether you want to post your videos on Snapchat Spotlight or want to know more about them, you just need to go through this article.</p><h2 id="What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat introduced Spotlight as a whole new section in its app that features several engaging short videos, also known as Snaps. The maximum duration of a video can be up to 1 minute or 60 seconds. Content creators must submit their videos to Spotlight so that moderators can review them and decide if they are worthy of featuring in the Spotlight section.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the intention of adding the Spotlight feature in Snapchat is to engage users through short-form user videos, just like TikTok. After the massive popularity gained by TikTok in 2020, many platforms tried following the same path to glory, including Snapchat and Instagram.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences"></a>Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences</h3><p>When comparing Snapchat and TikTok, there are specific differences that you can quickly notice. Let’s discuss those differences below:</p><p><strong>● Comments Sections</strong></p><p>While watching short-form videos on TikTok, you can leave your thoughts in the comments. However, you get no such comments section in the Snapchat Spotlight.</p><p><strong>● Privacy Protection</strong></p><p>If we talk about TikTok, you can view the display name of the content creator for each video. On the other hand, Snapchat enforces a strict privacy protection mechanism that hides the display name of creators if they are under 18. However, there’s an option to use a public profile if users below 18 wish to make their display name available to viewers.</p><h3 id="Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight"></a>Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight</h3><p>It’s easy to submit snaps (short-form videos) on Snapchat Spotlight. However, it is essential to ensure that your videos adhere to specific guidelines set by Snapchat. This section aims to make you familiar with them.</p><p><strong>Video Requirements</strong></p><p>The snaps that you want to submit to Spotlight should meet the following technical requirements:</p><ul><li>The minimum duration of a snap is 5 seconds, while the maximum is 60 seconds.</li><li>The video should be in portrait orientation.</li><li>The minimum aspect ratio of a snap is 3:4.</li><li>The horizontal resolution of a snap must be at least 640 px.</li><li>There shouldn’t be any logo in the snap.</li><li>The content of the snap should cover the complete frame.</li></ul><p>If your snap doesn’t meet the above-mentioned requirements, it will become ineligible for getting featured on Spotlight.</p><p><strong>Submission Terms</strong></p><p>There are certain community guidelines that apply to all Spotlight snaps. These guidelines ensure that the snaps within Spotlight entertain people without hurting their sentiments in any way.</p><p>While posting a snap on Spotlight, you need to avoid content that contains the following:</p><ul><li>Sexual acts</li><li>Harassment and bullying</li><li>Threats, violence, or harm</li><li>Illegal activities</li><li>Terrorism and hate speech</li></ul><p>You can go through the official <a class="link"   href="https://snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines" >Snapchat community guidelines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat Spotlight is relatively easy to use, especially if you are familiar with YouTube Shorts and TikTok. If you want to submit snaps to Spotlight, you will be happy to know that the whole process is quick and straightforward. The only thing that will consume a significant time is the snap creation itself.</p><p>If you already have a video or a snap idea that can make it to Spotlight, you need to know the steps for submitting a snap to Spotlight. We will discuss them in the next section.</p><h3 id="How-to-Post-on-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Post-on-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Post on Spotlight?"></a>How to Post on Spotlight?</h3><p>There are multiple methods to submit a snap to Spotlight. For example, you can create a new snap using the phone’s camera or advance an existing video from your gallery. Also, Snapchat lets you submit a snap to Spotlight from a desktop using a web browser.</p><p>Let’s discuss each method one by one below.</p><p><strong>From Phone</strong></p><p>Step1 Launch the Snapchat app on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-post-on-spotlight-from-phone-1.jpg"                      alt="open snapchat"                ></p><p>Step2 You can toggle between the front-facing and rear-facing cameras by tapping the camera toggle button or double-clicking on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-post-on-spotlight-from-phone-2.jpg"                      alt="take a snap"                ></p><p>Step3 There are other options on the screen as well, such as flash on&#x2F;off, add music, and more.

If a user views a snap multiple times in a single session, it will still be considered a unique view.</p><p><strong>Total View Time</strong></p><p>It represents the total time that users have spent watching a snap. If a user watches a single snap multiple times, the duration of each individual view will be added to the total view time.</p><p><strong>Number of Times the Video was Shared</strong></p><p>It represents the total number of times Snapchat users shared a particular snap with others.</p><p><strong>Number of Screenshots</strong></p><p>This factor considers the total number of times a screenshot was taken of a snap by a user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community"><a href="#Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community" class="headerlink" title="Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community"></a>Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community</h3><p>Your Snapchat community is your audience who loves to watch and interact with your snaps. Building a Snapchat community means growing your audience by delivering genuine, entertaining, and engaging content.</p><p>Here are some tips that can help you build a Snapchat community.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche</strong></p><p>Uploading random snaps will not earn you a loyal audience on Spotlight. So, you need to pick a specific niche, such as gaming, pranks, and comedy, to target a particular audience with your snaps.</p><p><strong>Use Snapchat’s Built-in Creative Tools</strong></p><p>Snapchat provides several tools to help you become more creative with your snaps. Using those creative tools is good as the Spotlight algorithm pretends to prioritize videos edited with Snapchat’s native tools.</p><p><strong>Stay Consistent</strong></p><p>It is challenging to post snaps consistently, especially if you are just starting. However, maintaining consistency with your Snaps will help you earn more audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey<p>Hopefully, you have known how to use Snapchat Spotlight and been ready to plan your creator life.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Complete-Hand-Tracking-Encyclopedia"><a href="#The-Complete-Hand-Tracking-Encyclopedia" class="headerlink" title="The Complete Hand-Tracking Encyclopedia"></a>The Complete Hand-Tracking Encyclopedia</h2><p>In the era of advancements, <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> is a fascinating technology with a great range of applications in both virtual and augmented reality.</p><p><strong>Hand Tracking</strong> is a process by which a computer can analyze and interpret the movement of a person’s hands. This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking"></a>Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing.

Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement.

The device offers a range of exciting features, including its generous battery life, outstanding appearance, enhanced telephoto camera, exceptionally smooth screen and innovative Face ID feature. Coming complete with a host of new and improved camera features, the iPhone X has helped Apple retain its reputation as one of the most pioneering and popular brands of all time. Let’s take a look at some of the0 <strong>best camera features</strong> the iPhone X has to offer right now.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The importance of depth</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to use portrait mode</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Video improvement</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera"><a href="#Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: TrueDepth Camera"></a>Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</h2><p> The phone has a brand new rear <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >camera with two lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a vertical orientation. This new orientation has been chosen to provide more space for the front-facing TrueDepth camera. This camera is tasked with powering the Face ID feature. The TrueDepth system also has a f&#x2F;2.2 7-megapixel camera for selfies. The feature means Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting are supported in front-facing mode. With Portrait Lighting, you can dynamically adjust your photo’s lighting with ease. TrueDepth uses an infrared emitter to project more than 30,000 in a recognised pattern onto users’ faces, before photographing the dots for analysis. The function is strengthened with a proximity sensor as well as an ambient light sensor which allows output light levels to be set.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-importance-of-depth"><a href="#Part-2-The-importance-of-depth" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The importance of depth"></a>Part 2: The importance of depth</h2><p> With previous versions of the iPhone Plus, the depth maps were only used to blur backgrounds and make subjects pop against them. However, the iPhone X takes the depth information from the two lenses as well as the efficiency of the A11 Bionic chip to offer outstanding new special effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/depth-iphone.jpg"                      alt="depth camera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to use portrait mode"></a>Part 3: How to use portrait mode</h2><p> Portrait mode uses your iPhone X’s telephoto lens kit to create images with “bokeh”-esque backgrounds and foregrounds. Portrait Lighting also comes as part of the Portrait Mode with the iPhone X, utilising both machine learning and the depth map of Portrait mode to add exceptional lighting effects to your photos in real time. When you shoot in Portrait mode, the wide-angle measures the difference between what it and the telephoto can see to offer a multi-point depth map. The depth map itself creates artificial depth of field.</p><p> There are many iOS 11 Camera app features available that will help you make the most of Portrait mode, including flash, filters, HDR and timed photos. You can even create a live-type Portrait photo by recording the screen of your device whilst in the Camera app.</p><p> To take a photo of a person in Portrait mode, take the following steps.</p><ul><li>Open your Camera app</li><li>Swipe to the Portrait settings</li><li>Stand between two to eight feet of your subject, allowing the face and body detection feature to identify your subject.</li><li>Follow the app’s prompts, which can include “Flash may help”, “move farther away”, and “more light required” amongst others.</li><li>The banner at the bottom of your screen will turn yellow once you have met the instructions</li><li>Swipe or tap the cube icons above your shutter button to change the lighting effects if needed.</li><li>To take your photo, press the shutter button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PortraitLighting.jpg"                      alt="portrait lighting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2201613&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macdvdripperpro.com/images/devices-3.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Video-improvement"><a href="#Part-4-Video-improvement" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video improvement"></a>Part 4: Video improvement</h2><p> The iPhone X is also noted for its first-class video shooting capabilities, including its 4K video feature. Though previous iterations of the iPhone were already rather adept at shooting in 4K, the new devices are even more impressive and have been favourably compared to the GH5 in terms of quality and clarity. The new device has been complimented for its vibrant colour profile and its ability to deliver 4K video that matches a wide range of leading DSLR and mirrorless cameras. It’s possible to capture video in 240fps slo-mo at 1080p and 4K at 60fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-improvement.JPG"                      alt="video improvement"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best iPhone Stabilizers for Video Shooting &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There are many great reasons for investing in the iPhone X if you are interested in carrying a high-end camera around in your pocket. The phone is the smallest yet to feature two 12MP rear-facing cameras, with the updated telephoto lens also being a big draw for many. The lens has been optically stabilised and had its aperture boosted to f&#x2F;2.4 from f&#x2F;2.8. The phone is now able to offer vastly superior performance in low-light conditions, with the sensor having been completely rebuilt and a brand new image signal processor offering stunning colours and textures. In fact, the phone is able to perform convincingly in low-light conditions even when there are multiple light sources competing.</p><p> The phone has also been praised for its wide range between light and dark colours. The Face ID function has proved to be incredibly secure, unlike earlier facial recognition systems which could easily be tricked by with the use of photographs or videos. It’s now possible to be more creative than ever with your iPhone’s camera whilst benefiting from a wealth of robust security features.</p><p><img                       lazyload

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-the-Landscape-SMM-Best-Practices"><a href="#Navigating-the-Landscape-SMM-Best-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Navigating the Landscape: SMM Best Practices"></a>Navigating the Landscape: SMM Best Practices</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-1.jpg"                      alt="introduction"                ></p><p>Within the world of social media marketing, there are many different strategies. All of these options can make it easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>But don’t worry! We’ve got some tried-and-true tips that can help you get started on your SMM journey.</p><h2 id="What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM"><a href="#What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM" class="headerlink" title="What is social media marketing (SMM)?"></a>What is social media marketing (SMM)?</h2><p>Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.</p><p>Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.</p><p>So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.</p><p><strong>1. Design Your Strategies</strong></p><p>You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.</p><p>After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it’s consistent!</p><p>Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values&#x2F;beliefs&#x2F;needs&#x2F;desires (whatever they may be).</p><p>Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).</p><p><strong>2. Starting Live Broadcast</strong></p><p>Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.</p><p>If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.</p><p>What You’ll Need:</p><ul><li>A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.</li><li>When using a laptop, ensure there’s no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what’s happening on screen when watching via computer&#x2F;laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).</li></ul><p><strong>3. Social Media Influencer</strong></p><p>Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p><p>Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.</p><p>Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts&#x2F;content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-2.jpg"                      alt="social media influencer"                ></p><p><strong>4. Create Subscription Options</strong></p><p>Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.</p><p>To create a subscription option:</p><ul><li>Navigate to “Customize” on the top right corner of your page and select “Subscription Options” from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Enter your desired name and description, then click “Save Changes” at the bottom of this section</li><li>To set up a subscription:</li></ul><p><strong>5. Engage with your Audience</strong></p><p>Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:</p><ul><li>Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they’re being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.</li><li>Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.</li><li>Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!</li></ul><p><strong>6. Create User Generated Content</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember that social media is about the community, so it’s important to encourage your audience members to create content.</p><p>If you’re not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you’re losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:</p><ul><li>Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.</li><li>If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Create a Positive Brand Image</strong></p><p>Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.</p><p>Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website’s design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-3.jpg"                      alt="create a positive brand image"                ></p><p>It’s a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there’s no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.</p><p><strong>8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand</strong></p><p>The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.</p><p>Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.</p><p><strong>9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends</strong></p><p>Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.</p><p><strong>10. Participate in Social Media Events</strong></p><p>Social media events can be a great way to get your name out there and promote your brand.</p><ul><li>They are a good way to get new leads.</li><li>You can also use social media events to build your brand’s reputation.</li></ul><h2 id="BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message"><a href="#BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message" class="headerlink" title="BONUS: Just keep sending out a message"></a>BONUS: Just keep sending out a message</h2><p>One of the most important things to remember is that consistency is the key. You need to be constantly promoting yourself, not just every so often. Don’t just post a message once and assume that people will see it and buy from you because they won’t!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-4.jpg"                      alt="bonus just keep sending out message"                ></p><p>It should be easy for people to find you on social media if they want to buy your products or services. You have to keep sending out messages and posting updates until they do!</p><p>Social media can be hard work sometimes but don’t give up hope; if you keep trying, it will eventually pay off!</p><!--

It focuses on making changes relevant to your target audience. You can do this during production from the device. For example, you can adjust your camera’s exposure when shooting your stills. As such, they appear more natural and unprocessed.</p><p>Additionally, you can do this in post-production, as the first step of your color grading photoshop process.</p><p>Some of the fixes you can do for color correction include:</p><ul><li>Eliminating dark spots and red eyes.</li><li>Changing the resolution to fit specific content. For example, you can adjust your photo to a 600 X 300 resolution to put it in a blog post.</li><li>Alternatively, you can color correct photos from different cameras to maintain consistency. Typically, you do this is for related content.</li><li>Finally, the vacation photos you want to share also include your ex. You can color correct them by cropping the section that has you and them.</li></ul><p>Now that you know the difference, why should you do them for your photos?</p><p>Both processes are essential to creating quality content and vary among creators. Some of the reasons include:</p><ul><li>You want to create a unique style that will make your content instantly recognizable. For example, you will immediately recognize a Quentin Tarantino movie thanks to the emphasis on red in his action scenes. Another example is Tyler Perry. He prefers brighter than usual color schemes.</li><li>Alternatively, you use color grading and color correction to create variation in scenes. For example, you can indicate a throwback photo by making it black and white.</li><li>Additionally, color grading photoshop is an excellent way to elicit different moods. For example, a color scheme that features bright yellows, greens, or blues can indicate different excitement levels.</li><li>Furthermore, you use color correction and color grading to indicate the importance of some scene sections. For example, news briefs are usually brighter than the rest of the shot, especially when displaying important messages, such as breaking news.</li><li>Finally, you do photoshop cinematic color grading to ensure consistency in your photos. Weather is unpredictable and can cause your scenes to vary dramatically. For example, some sections of your location may not receive similar lighting. As such, you can make those sections brighter through color grading in photoshop.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Simple-Ways-to-Color-Grading-in-Photoshop"><a href="#3-Simple-Ways-to-Color-Grading-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="3 Simple Ways to Color Grading in Photoshop"></a>3 Simple Ways to Color Grading in Photoshop</h2><p>Below are 3 simple ways to color grade in Photoshop.</p><h3 id="1-Using-Photo-Filter"><a href="#1-Using-Photo-Filter" class="headerlink" title="1.

Both are well recognised software platforms in players market with little ups and downs on few feature sets.</p><h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-MX-and-VLC-Player"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-MX-and-VLC-Player" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of MX and VLC Player"></a>Pros and Cons of MX and VLC Player</h2><p> The list of pros includes many similar kind of offers; they are described as:</p><p><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong></p><ul><li>Both of them follow hardware integration.</li><li>Offer wide range of customization possibilities for user platforms.</li><li>VLC as well as MX extends support to subtitle formats.</li><li>They offer multi support decoding facility.</li><li>Multiple languages are supported for subtitles.</li><li>Both these players support most of the video file formats.</li><li>The audio tracks can be altered dynamically as per need.</li></ul><p> The added advantage to VLC platform is that it handles all media files with smooth processing whereas handy widgets make home screen controls much easier.

The only option to get rid of these ads is to pay for the professional version that has additional advanced features. The pro version can definitely ensure high quality content delivery without causing unwanted clutters on screen.</p><p> The only difficulty that you can face with VLC player is that its beta version is not much stable but it is not a big issue for android user because the new update is quite stable and performs better. You will not find pop ads on VLC like MX player.</p><p> One more big difference between VLC and MX is that VLC can assist users in easy network streaming whereas MX lacks in this capability.</p><h2 id="Detailed-Comparison-of-VLC-and-MX-Player"><a href="#Detailed-Comparison-of-VLC-and-MX-Player" class="headerlink" title="Detailed Comparison of VLC and MX-Player"></a>Detailed Comparison of VLC and MX-Player</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-User-Interface"><a href="#The-User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="The User Interface"></a>The User Interface</h3><p> Users reviews say that the first appearance of MX player is not so impressive and do not even contain a well designed menu area that is popular in case of VLC. But one must say that MX is perfect choice if you want to stay focused with video content delivery. Other than annoying ads, you will not find any other distraction on its interface.</p><p> In case of VLC, you can definitely enjoy finest screen controls with well managed search menu and it also offers refresh options to stay tuned with updated library.

Both of these offer great content delivery but you can put VLC on higher side just because of its ability to play videos without cluttering screen with ads. MX keeps on distracting users with so many ads that can even cover your desired video content on screen. You need to make payment to get pro version of MX that is free from ads but VLC is always free with loads of quality features.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Extra-Features"><a href="#Extra-Features" class="headerlink" title="Extra Features"></a>Extra Features</h3><p> Developers often keep on improving their media player software with advanced features so that viewers can enjoy incredible experience.

It weighs down your device making it heavy for any other videos to open. While closing a browser or a tab, the OS deletes thousands of small sized files that are automatically downloaded in order to open the web pages. When you do not close the browsers properly and shut down your device, the files stored automatically weighs down the browser, effecting faster live streaming and loading speed. Thus, prior to doing live streaming, open the browser settings and delete the recently used history and other provisional Internet files in order to increase live streaming speed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Connect-WIFI-When-It-Is-Available"><a href="#Part-5-Connect-WIFI-When-It-Is-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available"></a>Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available</h2><p> For any heavy file download or live streaming, mobile data usage can ruin your experience and it is also too much consuming, whether data or time.

Now, by integrating Artificial Intelligent features, we can use any online photo background changer to instantly remove the existing background of our images (or replace it with a new one). From all the available options, I have listed some of the most perfect photo background changer tools that you can readily use.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</h2><p>Ideally, you can consider using an image background changer due to either of the following reasons:</p><ul><li>While clicking an image, there could be unwanted objects or too many people in the background.</li><li>You might have to completely remove the background of an image and use it for any other purpose.</li><li>Chances are that you might want to use your photo for a professional task, and its background could not be so appealing.</li><li>There could be any other creative reason for you to remove the background of a photo and apply any other layer instead.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers"></a>Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</h2><p>If you are looking for a reliable online photo background changer tool, then you can consider exploring the following solutions:</p><h4 id="2-Remove-BG"><a href="#2-Remove-BG" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove BG"></a>2. Remove BG</h4><p>Remove BG is a perfect photo background changer tool that is extremely easy to use. Once the photo is uploaded, it will automatically detect human figures and will remove its background. You can then add any other background of your choice – texture, bold colors, customized images, and so on. If you want, you can freely download the image for 0.25 megapixels, but to download an HD image, you have to pay one credit per photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-removebg.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer removebg"                ></p><h4 id="3-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#3-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="3. Adobe Spark"></a>3. Adobe Spark</h4><p>If you are looking for a hassle-free solution to change a photo’s background, then you can also try Adobe Spark. The online tool is powered by Adobe and will let you upload any JPG or PNG photos. Afterward, the application will remove the background of the image and will let you save it as a PNG file that you can overlap on any background of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-spark.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer spark"                ></p><h4 id="4-Wondershare-PixCut"><a href="#4-Wondershare-PixCut" class="headerlink" title="4. Wondershare PixCut"></a>4. Wondershare PixCut</h4><p>Developed by Wondershare, PixCut is a free online background changer tool that you can use on any browser. To use it, you just have to go to its official website and simply upload any photo. Now, the online tool would automatically remove the background of your photo with its smart AI features. Later, PixCut will let you save the file in the PNG format that you can edit on any application on your system or mobile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wondershare-pixcut.jpg"                      alt="wondershare pixcut"                ></p><h4 id="5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover"></a>5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Slazzer has come up with a wide range of utility tools, including an online photo background changer. The tool supports PNG and JPG files and would let you automatically remove the background of an image. Its AI features can automatically detect all the popular figures like human faces, cars, trees, pets, and so on. However, using Slazzer, you can only remove the background of an image and would have to insert a new background on another tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-slazzer.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer slazzer"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer"><a href="#6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6. Fotor Photo Background Changer"></a>6. Fotor Photo Background Changer</h4><p>Fotor offers a couple of online features related to photo editing and this one is another smart tool that you can use on its website. The image background changer is easy to use, can remove the background of any photo, and let you replace it with a new one. While it offers some of the most advanced features for online image editing, the application is not available for free (and would cost around $8.99 per month).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-fotor.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer fotor"                ></p><h4 id="7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover"></a>7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Clip Magic also offers a smart and quick solution to change the background of an image online. Once the photo is loaded to the online application, it will let you get rid of the background easily (without any technical hassle). Apart from that, you can also use its smart editor to make all kinds of minor changes to your photos easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-clip-magic.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer clip magic"                ></p><h4 id="8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover"><a href="#8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover"></a>8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover</h4><p>As the name suggests, this is a freely available image editor that can also be used to change a photo’s background. Since it is an online tool, you can use it on any website without downloading anything on your system. Once the photo is manually uploaded, the application will automatically detect a figure (like a human face, car, or any other object). It will now crop the area of the figure and would remove its background, letting you change it later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-edit-photos.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer edit photos"                ></p><h4 id="9-Foco-Clipping"><a href="#9-Foco-Clipping" class="headerlink" title="9. Foco Clipping"></a>9. Foco Clipping</h4><p>The next perfect photo background changer that I would recommend is from Foco Clipping. One of the best things about this online tool is that it can remove the background of multiple images at the same time. You can upload your photos in a bulk, let it process them, and remove their background. The image background changer is known for its exceptional results for cropping human figures with precise body and hair scaling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-foco.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer foco"                ></p><h4 id="10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer"><a href="#10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="10.PicsArt Image Background Changer"></a>10.PicsArt Image Background Changer</h4><p>The online photo background changer by PicsArt is quite easy to use and offers a wide range of features. You can upload your photos one by one and can manually edit them on its interface. The application can automatically remove the background of your image and would let you save it as a PNG file on your system (to be used offline with any other application).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-picsart.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer picsart"                ></p><h4 id="11-Cut-Out-Pro-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#11-Cut-Out-Pro-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="11. Cut Out Pro Photo Background Remover"></a>11. Cut Out Pro Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Lastly, if you are looking for a free online background changer tool, then you can head to the website of Cut Out Pro. You can upload a photo from your computer’s storage or simply paste its URL. The application can automatically detect human figures, pets, cars, trees, designs, and several other objects. After removing the background, you can apply any other color, effect, or design as a background on its native interface as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-cutout.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer cutout"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048963/16384" target="_top" id="2048963"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048963"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048963/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to do a background change online of any photo of yours.

The company has been producing high-quality aerial photography drones over the last few years and the first blade 350QX was released just two years ago. Since that time Horizon Hobby has produced several new versions of the Blade and the Chroma is the first one to enable the use of a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Although the 4k version is not the standard version of the Chroma, it is one of the newest and best available in their line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-quadcopter-drone.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k"                ></p><p> The staple of this configuration is a performance drawn that also includes a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3-axis gimbal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mount that is designed to use a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The Chroma 4k quad copter comes with a CGO3 4k camera or a CGO2+ camera capable of shooting in 1080p. The device can also come with a gimbal made for a GoPro which can be bought separately. The idea of including the attachment for a GoPro is to have a performance drawn that’s capable of competing with the GoPro Karma line by using the same quality camera.</p><h2 id="Pros-and-cons-of-Blade-Chroma"><a href="#Pros-and-cons-of-Blade-Chroma" class="headerlink" title="Pros and cons of Blade Chroma"></a>Pros and cons of Blade Chroma</h2><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><ol><li>One of the best parts of using this style of drone is that it comes with a wealth of repair parts and a fantastic range for both the battery as well as for control. Horizon Hobby has always been known for producing performance drones as well as offering some of the best customer service in the market. You will always be able to find parts for this drone as well as instructions on how to repair it and this can really improve the longevity of the device.</li><li>The camera that comes with this drone is also fairly competitive. Although it may not be able to compete with the latest go pro models, it can deliver close to the same image quality with a fair resiliency in several different types of weather.</li><li>The device has some of the best battery life out of any quad copter on the market currently with a flight time rated at up to 30 min.<br> <strong>Cons:</strong></li><li>One of the drawbacks to using this device firstly is that this may not be a drone that you can afford a second battery for. Because the developers used such a large battery to improve flight time, a secondary battery will cost you several hundred dollars.</li><li>Flight times also begin to drop off considerably especially when recording in 4K. Although the replacement parts are easy to source they also grow quite expensive due to the high quality performance of this drone.</li><li>Unlike some other drones in the same price point this one also doesn’t feature anything like GPS Waypoint or some of the collision detection and control features that can be found on similar drones in the price point.<br><strong>Verdict</strong></li></ol><p> Overall this device is fairly easy to use and the camera can be fairly good when compared to other 4K experiences in the same price point. If you are a beginner with drones or you are looking for a device that can fly with autonomous GPS precision, this may not be the right drone for you to pick however. Pilots that want full control at all times are going to enjoy the performance of this drone however.</p><h2 id="Complete-Review-for-Blade-Chroma-Drone"><a href="#Complete-Review-for-Blade-Chroma-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Complete Review for Blade Chroma Drone"></a>Complete Review for Blade Chroma Drone</h2><p> With a drone that’s designed to be extremely versatile and balanced, the Chroma line of drones is designed for his resiliency and it really resembles the look of a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Yuneec Typhoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> style quad copter. The battery is extremely light weight but also quite powerful and this can improve the speed and performance of the drone while maximizing its weight balanced. The stabilization on this drone for image quality is quite easy to predict and this can be helpful on a drone especially when there is very little in the way of GPS waypoint.</p><h4 id="1-Battery"><a href="#1-Battery" class="headerlink" title="1.  Battery"></a>1.  Battery</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is fairly decent. The 6300mAH battery is one of the largest available on a quad copter today. It takes just under two hours to charge but the replacement batteries are additional batteries can get quite expensive at $120 each minimum. The three cell battery does often keep this drone in flight for 25+ minutes at a time but with the prices for replacement or additional batteries, you may find yourself charging it often.</p><h4 id="2-Flight-Performance"><a href="#2-Flight-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.  Flight Performance"></a>2.  Flight Performance</h4><p> There are several different flight modes including Smart Mode, Aerial Photography Mode, Follow Me&#x2F;Tracking Mode as well as Return to Home Mode:</p><p> Smart mode is made for beginners while the AP mode is best for the more experienced pilots. The Follow Me mode allows you to focus on lining up the perfect shot as the drone follows you from a distance you preset. Tracking Mode makes the quadcopter follow and keeps the camera focused on whoever is carrying the controller, and the Return Home feature ensures safe landings with just one flip of a switch.</p><h4 id="3-Controller"><a href="#3-Controller" class="headerlink" title="3.  Controller"></a>3.  Controller</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-4k-controller.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k controller"                ></p><p> ST10+ controller has a built-in 5.5-inch touchscreen display to deliver a live view from the camera, making it easy to see how much battery life has been used, how fast the drone is flying as well as other flight information. There’s a little bit of lag between the camera and screen, and the screen lacks the brightness control which makes it hard to observe the info when you are outside on a sunny day.</p><h4 id="4-Camera"><a href="#4-Camera" class="headerlink" title="4.  Camera"></a>4.  Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-4k-camera.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k camera"                ></p><p> The camera can produce some fairly decent images the UHD quality is great with 4K at 30 frames per second. If you want to get the most out of zoomed shots however, the images on this drone can start to show a bit of rough edges. It’s not great in darker conditions or with shadows especially when compared to the GoPro as well.</p><p> Overall this drone is a lot of fun to fly and it can shoot excellent quality video with the chance to change out the camera for a GoPro if possible. The device is also known for its agility as well as its stability. Although you can’t set GPS flight pattern areas, there are economist modes as well as safeguards which can prevent the drone from crashing into obstacles. This drone is something that’s usually recommended for more experienced pilots but for its base price it can be a lot of fun to use with quality performance and flight time. Professionals will definitely want to upgrade to the 4k camera or use a different camera from the base model however.</p><p><img                       lazyload
