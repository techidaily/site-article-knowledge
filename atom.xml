Here’s a guide on using GIPHY to create a meme video.</p><p><strong>Steps to Create Meme on Giphy:</strong></p><p>Step1 Download and launch the app, then register for an account or sign in if you already have one. Tap on Create in the top-right corner of the homepage. Utilize the icon in the upper right corner to access your GIPHY account. It takes two seconds to create a GIPHY account if you don’t already have one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/download-giphy-app.jpg"                      alt="download giphy app"                ></p><p>Step2 To upload a video to GIPHY, click Upload. To add a video from your computer or mobile device, choose ‘Choose File’ as there is an option to do so</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/upload-video-to-giphy.jpg"                      alt="upload video to giphy"                ></p><p>Step3 If you wish to upload a video from a URL, you may do so. After you’ve submitted your movie, you’ll be sent to the next page automatically so that you may cut it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/upload-video-url-giphy.jpg"                      alt="upload video url giphy"                ></p><p>Step4 Set the sliders to the length that you choose for your GIF. Recall that shorter is always better! Click Upload Now to continue. The next page gives you the choice of adding tags, making your GIF private, adding a source URL, or adding it to a collection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Make-Meme-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Make-Meme-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Alternative Way to Make Meme Video"></a>Part 2. Alternative Way to Make Meme Video</h2><p>Giphy should be a desirable option for content and advertising partners due to the search engine and the thorough social integration of its content. The language of the internet is memes. Despite the fact that some of them may be somewhat strange. There is a text option in every specialized video editing program, but <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides something more eye-catching for you! You may create inspiring graphics with quotes using the hundreds of other stock images that Filmora provides, as well as share personal stories, talk about current events, and more. You may also make use of your own images.</p><p>There are innumerable varieties of memes, but the ones that most people are familiar with are just pictures with a few lines of text. A video may easily have text added to it. Given that having certain video editing skills boosts the hilarity of your memes, you may employ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> professional video editing options.

This is due to the launch of platforms like Twitch and Youtube, which have made it easier for content creators&#x2F;streamers to reach a wide audience. But how do these two platforms differ?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a comprehensive look at <strong>Twitch vs. Youtube</strong> by comparing their browsing, content rule leniency, growth, and monetization. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of which platform is right for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-vs-youtube.jpg"                      alt="twitch vs youtube"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube"></a>Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube</h2><p>Though Twitch and YouTube share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two:</p><p><strong>Browsing:</strong> Twitch and YouTube are search engines, but they differ in how they recommend videos to viewers. Twitch focuses on more popular streamers and doesn’t let users edit their thumbnails, while YouTube makes it easier for newbies to be found with a customizable thumbnail feature.</p><p><strong>Content Rule Leniency:</strong> Twitch and YouTube’s content guidelines are slightly different. YouTube is more easygoing when it comes to what videos can be posted. On the other hand, Twitch has a reputation for banning streamers without any justification. Even streamers with contracts seem to be treated the same as anyone else when this happens.</p><p><strong>Growth:</strong> YouTube offers more advantages over Twitch in terms of growth as it is more accessible and has a better algorithm that allows small content creators to grow their channels quickly. However, Twitch mainly focuses on popular content streamers and offers fewer growth opportunities for newbies.</p><p><strong>Monetization:</strong> When it comes to monetization, both platforms offer different options for content creators. On Twitch, content creators can earn revenue from subscriptions, sponsored advertisements, donations, affiliate programs, merchandise sales, etc. On YouTube, content creators can earn revenue from direct advertisements, sponsorships, partnership programs, streams, donations, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="youtube monetization"                ></p><p><strong>Chat and Moderation Policies:</strong> Twitch uses a time-based strict chat moderation policy and does not have the pause or rewind option. While on YouTube, the chat is arranged based on relevance and comes with only standard emojis for visual presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Over the past few years, two of the biggest platforms for streaming gaming content have been Twitch and YouTube. So which platform is worth using? Let’s find out!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-gaming.jpg"                      alt="twitch gaming"                ></p><p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Twitch algorithm is mainly based on the number of viewers on your videos. Moreover, when browsing, it mainly suggests only the popular streamers with a strong subscriber base.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube is owned by Google and creates more opportunities for streamers to be found. Also, its search algorithm takes into account the number of likes, comments, and shares on your video.</p><p><strong>Streamer-Viewer Dynamics:</strong> On Twitch, viewers often get more involved with the streamer as opposed to YouTube gaming viewers, who prefer to watch videos without commentary.</p><p><strong>Engagement Requirements For Streamers:</strong> To grow on YouTube, you need at least 4000 hours of watch time and a good number of likes, shares, and comments on your video. While on Twitch, you need at least a 20-30% engagement rate and a large number of subscribers.</p><p><strong>Competition Level Of Streamer:</strong> YouTube has fewer streamers but a 20 times more extensive user base. The potential for growth for new streamers is much higher due to the lower competition on the platform. Additionally, the platform provides more prominent exposure for new content creators.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h3><p>Twitch is a better streaming platform if you want to cultivate a following around your content.

Ad revenues are based on the number of impressions (views) your content receives, and the average payout is $0.25 - $1.50 per 1,000 views.</p><p><strong>Bits</strong>: As a streamer on Twitch, you can also receive donations from your viewers in the form of a unique currency on the platform known as Bits. It’s important to note that Twitch takes a 29% cut-off of all donations made this way, leaving the streamer with 71% of the total donation.

This is the cheaper way of ensuring that the streamer gets the entire donation amount from the viewer.<p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> Subscribers can support your channel by getting a subscription for a minimum of $4.99 per month. Twitch only takes 50% of subscription fees. This makes it much more profitable for streamers, as they can earn $2.50 per subscription per month.</p><p><strong>Merchandise:</strong> In terms of merchandise, Twitch has an advantage over YouTube because it comes with various merchandising extensions that can help you to make sales directly to your viewers during a live stream without the need for them to leave the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-monetization.jpg"                      alt="twitch monetization"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002162&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/1_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (1 PC) Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Pay Their Streamers"></a>How YouTube Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>YouTube pays its streamers in three different ways:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> Once your channel reaches a specific threshold, you become eligible for displaying ads on your YouTube channel. YouTube ads pay more than Twitch. For each 1000 ad views, you will get $18, which means you can earn up to $3 to $5 per 1k video views.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> YouTube members are equivalent to Twitch’s subscribers. YouTube pays 70% of membership fees to the creators. The eligibility to offer channel memberships opens up at 30,000 subscribers for all types of channels, but for gaming channels, in particular, a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are required. Additionally, creators must also be a part of the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p><strong>Super Chat:</strong> Youtube pays streamers 70% of each super chat donation made on the platform and retains 30%. While this may seem to be expensive, it helps cover the costs of hosting a Livestream. Without this donation, Youtube would not be able to function as smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-super-chat.jpg"                      alt="youtube super chat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Which-Pays-More"><a href="#Which-Pays-More" class="headerlink" title="Which Pays More?"></a>Which Pays More?</h3><p>Due to the lower threshold for monetization, Twitch pays more to the new content creators and offers more monetization options.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enhancing-Collaboration-with-Win11-and-Zoom-Techniques"><a href="#Enhancing-Collaboration-with-Win11-and-Zoom-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing Collaboration with Win11 and Zoom Techniques"></a>Enhancing Collaboration with Win11 and Zoom Techniques</h2><p>The need for technology for remote conferencing has never been greater as more individuals across numerous industries begin working from home. While physical offices are closed, services like Zoom for win10, which provide online meetings and video conversations, are more important than ever for keeping organizations operating effectively. Although the Zoom win 7 platform is pretty simple to use, depending on whether you use the desktop or mobile version, its core features are set up significantly differently for Zoom win 10. Find the details in the upc0oming sections to learn about Zoom for win10.</p><p>The increasing demand of Zoom in Windows 7 has resultantly enforced users to use Zoom win 10 on their new window versions. Fortunately, installing Zoom on your PC is a quick and easy procedure that will have you using the service in no time. One of the most popular video conferencing systems is now Zoom. You may have noticed that you didn’t have to register to attend if you’ve ever attended a Zoom win 7 meeting. Zoom requires that you create a free account and as soon as Zoom for win10 has been installed on your computer, you may start using it right away. Here are the details.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Download-Zoom-Desktop-Client"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Download-Zoom-Desktop-Client" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Download Zoom Desktop Client"></a>Part 1. How to Download Zoom Desktop Client</h2><p>A popular trend, particularly in the last two years, is working from home. Although the Basic plan that is free has a 40-minute time restriction on group meetings, Zoom is accessible for download for free. However, you are permitted to hold an infinite number of one-on-one meetings and group meetings with up to 100 participants. If you want more, you may upgrade to the Pro plan, which raises the 24-hour meeting time limit and adds admin controls and features like a personalized meeting ID and user management.</p><p><strong>Steps to Download Zoom Desktop Client:</strong></p><p>As we are all aware, Zoom allows us to host meetings, attend lectures, and see webinars. As opposed to conventional offices and schools, Zoom also makes it feasible and simpler to capture a screen during a conference. It is important to understand how to download it because of this.</p><p>Step1Launch the web browser on your computer and go to Zoom.us to access the Zoom website. In the website’s footer, at the bottom of the page, click Download tab and the options are visible as follows:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-client-download-center.jpg"                      alt="zoom client download center"                ></p><p>Step2Now, on the “Zoom Client for Meetings” tab of the Download Center, click “Download.” Afterwards, allow the app to make changes to your PC by pressing Run as shown below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/authorize-zoom-install.jpg"                      alt="authorize zoom install"                ></p><p>Step3After that, the Zoom software will start downloading. After that, you should click the.exe file to begin the installation procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-successfully-pc.jpg"                      alt="install zoom successfully pc"                ></p><p>Step4Once the software is installed, you must enter into your Zoom account. If you don’t already have one, you may create one by visiting the Zoom website. After creating it, you may use Zoom as usual for all of your requirements for online meetings and video conversations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/sign-in-zoom-meet.jpg"                      alt="sign in zoom meet"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Zoom-on-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Zoom-on-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Use Zoom on Windows PC"></a>Part 2. How to Use Zoom on Windows PC</h2><p>One of the most well-liked options for video conferencing is Zoom. Cross-platform compatibility is one of the factors contributing to its success. Instead of installing a program on their PCs, Zoom also allows users to attend a meeting through a Web browser.

Your key light, in this case your window, is off to one side. It will cast a shadow over half of your face which you soften using your fill light. Your backlight is a light you put behind you to help you pop out of your background.</p><p> Another thing that can help you pop out from your background is focusing your keylight so that its light is only landing on you, not your background.</p><p> Rather than setting up professional lights for your fill and backlights try using household lamps or reflectors. Reflectors are used to bounce light from another source, so if you set one up opposite to the window it will redirect light back at the shaded side of your face.</p><p> Reflectors are very affordable, often around $20, but if you do not have one then you can use a sheet of aluminum foil.</p><h4 id="2-Windows-as-Front-Lights"><a href="#2-Windows-as-Front-Lights" class="headerlink" title="2. Windows as Front Lights"></a>2. Windows as Front Lights</h4><p> Vlogging while facing a window is a great way to get even lighting over your entire face. This is a great set up for makeup tutorials or other beauty vlogs. It can also work for opinion vloggers, or any other vlogging genre where the focus is on a stationary host, though.</p><p> The only issue that can arise when you use a window as a front light for your vlog is that you do not stand out from your background because the lighting is even on both you and it. This is not difficult to get around; you just need a backlight.</p><p> You can use a household lamp or a reflector as a backlight. The idea is that the light hitting you from behind will create a boarder around you that will make you pop out from the background of your shot.</p><h4 id="3-Windows-as-Backlights"><a href="#3-Windows-as-Backlights" class="headerlink" title="3. Windows as Backlights"></a>3. Windows as Backlights</h4><p> It is usually a bad idea to use a window as a backlight because they are too bright. Shooting with a window behind you will not just give you a dark boarder, like a lamp or a reflector; it will completely transform you into a silhouette. This is an interesting effect in some situations, but not in a vlog where your viewers are expecting to be able to see you. It is sometimes possible to make this kind of shot work by increasing your exposure, but then you might end up with over-exposed footage. Pushing the ‘info’ button a couple times will allow you to check you exposure on most DSLRs.</p><h4 id="4-Diffusers"><a href="#4-Diffusers" class="headerlink" title="4. Diffusers"></a>4. Diffusers</h4><p> A diffuser is a screen of translucent fabric you can use to soften your light. The light coming from your window might be hard on your eyes, and setting up a diffuser between you and your window can help you not to blink. Often when reflectors come in colored sets one of the ‘colors’ will be translucent and you can use it as a diffuser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-screen-review-snapshot-is-active-8-top-tier-or-not/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Screen Review Snapshot  Is Active 8 Top-Tier or Not?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-breaking-records-olympics-showcase-for-short-tracks/"><u>[New] Breaking Records  Olympics Showcase for Short Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-cultivating-patience-with-youtube-disapproval/"><u>[New] Cultivating Patience with YouTube Disapproval</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-drone-balance-7-top-rated-gimbals/"><u>[New] Drone Balance  7 Top-Rated Gimbals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-free-fb-music-journey-begins-here-for-2024/"><u>[New] Free FB Music Journey Begins Here for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-tips-for-easily-accessing-videos-on-facebook-for-2024/"><u>[New] Tips for Easily Accessing Videos on Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-interactive-content-platform-audit-and-rating/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Interactive Content Platform Audit & Rating</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-video-capturing-warriors-choosing-between-obs-and-fraps/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Video Capturing Warriors  Choosing Between OBS and Fraps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-which-vimeo-e-sy-option-suits-your-needs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Which Vimeo E-Sy Option Suits Your Needs?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-capture-chuckles-quickly-efficient-methods-for-exciting-youtube-reaction-videos-3-tips-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capture Chuckles Quickly  Efficient Methods for Exciting YouTube Reaction Videos (3 Tips) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-roundup-best-3ds-on-pc-simulator-tools/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Premium Roundup  Best 3Ds on PC Simulator Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-visual-journey-mastering-the-art-of-incorporating-text-into-images-on-pcmacos/"><u>2024 Approved  A Visual Journey  Mastering the Art of Incorporating Text Into Images on PC/MacOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-alives-low-residue-sound-technique/"><u>2024 Approved  Alive's Low-Residue Sound Technique</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-an-all-inclusive-examination-of-inshots-video-edits/"><u>2024 Approved  An All-Inclusive Examination of InShot's Video Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-androids-optimal-cloud-savers-updated-list/"><u>2024 Approved  Android's Optimal Cloud Savers Updated List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-assessing-visual-clarity-entering-aurora-hdr-territory/"><u>2024 Approved  Assessing Visual Clarity  Entering Aurora HDR Territory</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-basic-approach-tweaking-clownfish-tones-in-windoze/"><u>2024 Approved  Basic Approach  Tweaking Clownfish Tones in Windoze</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-chirping-cha-cha-charade/"><u>2024 Approved  Chirping Cha-Cha Charade</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-compare-metaverse-vs-omniverse-an-ultimate-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Compare Metaverse Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Trusted-6-Platforms-Supporting-Biz-Success-Stories"><a href="#Trusted-6-Platforms-Supporting-Biz-Success-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Trusted 6 Platforms Supporting Biz Success Stories"></a>Trusted 6 Platforms Supporting Biz Success Stories</h2><p>Social media is a great way of promoting your business. With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here’s a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg"                      alt="business social media platforms"                ></p><h2 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It’s the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business.

There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business.

As I understand things, this is because Dolby HDR is not supported.</em></p><p><em>Is there a workaround I can use to get the color back in my videos?</em></p><p><em>Also, any ideas when Adobe will eventually provide support for Dolby HDR?” – A user asked from Adobe Support Community</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="solutions for iphone hdr"                ></p><p>While the Adobe Premiere Pro software is useful tool for video editing, there are situations when the video quality looks overexposed. The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a ().</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to video  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here.

So, overall, using this software is the best option to try to <strong>convert HDR video to SDR iPhone,</strong> in our experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to edit iPhone HDR video using Filmora?</strong></p><p>Step1Install Filmora and launch the software on your Mac device.</p><p>Step2Click on New Project &gt; Click here to import media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-4.jpg"                      alt="click on new project"                ></p><p>Choose the HDR video from the iPhone device that you transferred to the device in QuickTime Movie format (MOV).</p><p>Step3Drag and drop the video to the timeline section for editing the file.</p><p>Step4Make the necessary edits like Color Matching and Chroma key-based background removal&#x2F;editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-5.jpg"                      alt="make edits"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step5Click on the Export button on top of the screen.</p><p>Step6Go to the Device tab and choose iPhone.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a ().</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to video  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using.

This is because the Dolby Vision effect is not compatible with many devices and platforms and is not an issue with editing software like Premiere Pro. You can fix the problem by disabling the HDR effect, using a high-quality video editor like Filmora, or changing the color codec.</p><p><a class="link"

A video summary is an outro: you may see a video outro as the conclusion at the end of an article. Thus, your outro must be concise, captivating, and easy to digest. Outro templates are ready-made short videos, either editable or not editable**.

Well, no need to waste your energy. The iPhone camera offers just the perfect feature to counter this problem - the HDR feature.</p><p>Most people have to use photo editing software to fix the exposures of photos, but luckily for us, we don’t need that.</p><p>In this article, we will give you a brief overview of HDR photography and then guide you on how to shoot HDR photos with an iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?</h2><p>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range, and it refers to a photography technique where multiple exposures of a scene are combined to create one well-lit picture. It captures a scene’s darkest and lightest tone and shows them as such in the final photo.</p><p>Apple introduced the HDR feature back in 2010 on iPhone 4. It was a breakthrough for the company, further enhancing the iPhone camera. Since then, all the succeeding models of the iPhone have the HDR feature.</p><p>However, Apple has advanced its HDR technology with the passage of time. Before the release of the iPhone 12, Apple worked with HDR10. With the iPhone 12, Apple inculcated Dolby Vision HDR, becoming the first to roll out Dolby Vision in a mobile handset.</p><p>Without the HDR feature, your iPhone camera is not capable of capturing a high-contrast scene. This will lead you to having exposure problems in your pictures.</p><p>Your scene might have dark tones that are well exposed with the right colors and details, but the bright areas might be over-exposed with no shade or detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot"                ></p><p>On the other hand, your scene might have bright tones that are well-exposed with the right color and details, but the dark areas are too dark to show the details.</p><p>Alt text: HDR shoot with different exposure</p><p>With the iPhone’s HDR feature, you can get a perfectly exposed photo showing details simultaneously in light and dark tones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot with different exposure"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?"></a>Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?</h2><p>Now that we know how HDR helps make our pictures pop out, let’s look at how you can take an HDR photo with your iPhone camera.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?"></a>How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?</h3><p>Here is a step-by-step guide for you to follow.

By default, Smart HDR does not save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><p>The “Keep Normal Photo” option is helpful in instances where you might have to compare the HDR and non-HDR versions. You may even prefer the non-HDR version in some cases.</p><p>But the side effect of this feature is that it becomes a nuisance to delete the other versions, and it also takes up space.</p><p>Here is how you can disable this setting and avoid having two same photos.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings-1"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>Go to your iPhone Settings and tap on the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option"><a href="#Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option"></a>Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option</h5><p>You will see a “Keep Normal Photo” toggle in the HDR panel. Turn the toggle off.</p><p>Once the toggle is off, you can go and take an HDR photo. The camera app will no longer save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?"></a>Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?</h2><p>The iPhone’s HDR option enables you to get great shots. Apple introduced a “Smart HDR” option on iPhone where the camera shoots photos in HDR (when necessary) by default. This option ensures that users don’t have to go to great lengths to get amazing shots.</p><p>However, there may be instances when you feel that the “Smart HDR” option is not working.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App"></a><strong>Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App</strong></h3><p>There may be a case where you open your Camera app to take a picture in HDR but there is no HDR option available to you. This is usually the case with iPhone 13 models, and its pro variants.</p><p>Well, the reason behind it is that Apple has added a new feature in these models that the Camera is set to capture HDR shots by default. So, users do not have the option to control the HDR feature.</p><p>It certainly takes away the control that users had in their shots because not all HDR images turn out to be perfect. Especially while zooming into things, the images start looking like a painting. However, it works just fine in most cases.</p><h3 id="Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max"></a><strong>Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max</strong></h3><p>Certain iPhone XS Max users are facing a problem where the Photos app does not show whether the image is an HDR image or not. Previously, users could see an “HDR” tag on their photos. However, recently the tags are not visible anymore.</p><p>Worry not, this does not mean that your Smart HDR is not working. You can check this by disabling Smart HDR from Settings &gt; Camera. Once Smart HDR is disabled, go to the Camera app and take a picture without HDR. Compare the before and after images to see if your HDR feature is working or not.</p><p>Such instances of Smart HDR may occur but you don’t need to worry too much about them. The simple solutions mentioned above will surely fix your problem. In case they don’t help, you can contact the Apple Support to get your queries resolved.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device"><a href="#Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device"></a>Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device</h2><p>HDR photography is a really cool technique that can really make your content more appealing.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Securing-a-Seamless-SRT-Upload-Experience-on-Social-Networks"><a href="#Securing-a-Seamless-SRT-Upload-Experience-on-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Securing a Seamless SRT Upload Experience on Social Networks"></a>Securing a Seamless SRT Upload Experience on Social Networks</h2><p>If you’re a content creator, then you should know the importance of adding subtitles to your videos.</p><p>Today, a lot of social media users, especially on Facebook, tend to watch videos without turning on the sounds. But the big question is ‘If your audience doesn’t turn on the sound of your videos, how do they get the message you’re trying to pass?” Well, this is why adding ‘Subtitles’ to your videos is crucial. However, for a subtitle to work, it needs to comply with the structure of a video player or any platform you intend to use it on. And fortunately, SRT is a universal format, making it usable on any social media platform.</p><p>In this guide, you’ll be introduced to the simple methods you can utilize to upload SRT files to social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. But before we proceed, let’s take a look at an overview of the different social media platforms and the subtitle file formats they support.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Social Media Platform</th><th>SRT</th><th>VTT</th><th>STL</th><th>SSA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YouTube</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vimeo</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the overview table above, it’s obvious you can easily create one SRT file and easily use it on different social media channels. This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to. Then click ‘Add Language’ and select the language you wrote your Subtitle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="add language"                ></p><p>Step3Click Add under the Subtitle section and upload your SRT file through the pop-up that appears on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets"><a href="#Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets"></a>Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets</h2><p>Before now, Twitter users can only upload SRT files to video via the ‘Media Studio’, but this feature was not available to all users, making it difficult for some users to add subtitles to their videos.</p><p>However, the new version of Twitter now allows users to easily add SRT files to their tweets from the ‘Compose Tweet’ area. This made uploading SRT to tweet very straightforward. All you just have to do is to compose a tweet with your video then use the “Upload Caption File (.srt)” option to upload the SRT file. See the process to complete the action below;</p><p>Step1Open Twitter on your device and click the relevant button to compose a new tweet.</p><p>Step2Upload the video you want to add the SRT file to. Then select ‘Upload Caption File’ (.srt) below the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-tweets-1.jpg"                      alt="upload caption file"                ></p><p>Step3Click on ‘Upload Caption’ from the pop-up that appears on your screen. Then choose the SRT file that you want to upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-tweets-2.jpg"                      alt="upload caption"                ></p><p>Step4Click Done. Then you’ll see the name of the language in your captions is written</p><p>Step5Now play the video to preview the subtitle and if you’re satisfied, publish your tweet instantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-tweets-3.jpg"                      alt="tweet instantly"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Your-Vimeo-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Your-Vimeo-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Upload SRT Files to Your Vimeo Video"></a>Part 3: Upload SRT Files to Your Vimeo Video</h2><p>Vimeo is another platform that’s similar to YouTube.

Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’.

Your website, blog, and other pages can be found by brand-new visitors or lead if you have optimized your pages for search terms.</p><p>Like any other content, podcasts are also created to be successful and reach audiences worldwide. As such, podcast SEO refers to improving the visibility of your podcasts in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Google-Show-Podcasts-in-SERPs"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Google-Show-Podcasts-in-SERPs" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Why Does Google Show Podcasts in SERPs?</h2><p>Over the years, podcasts have become an essential form of media content that covers various topics to be discussed, ranging from learning new skill sets, current affairs, music, comedy, and much more.</p><p>However, podcast hosts have found it challenging to promote their audio content. Not to mention making their podcasts more reachable around the world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast seo"                ></p><p>Considering this struggle of the podcasters, Google in the year 2019 announced that podcasts can now be indexed in SERPs.

Thus, it is much easier for people to look for, and discover the podcast by simply a relevant keyword.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Podcast-SEO-Tips-How-to-Optimize-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Podcast-SEO-Tips-How-to-Optimize-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Keywords are like the lifeline to any content, and podcast is no exception. So, adding the relevant keywords related to your topic and the ones commonly searched by the user will help you rank higher in the search results.</p><p>Spend some time and research to find the relevant keywords for your podcasts, and for a help of professional keyword generators can also be taken. Some popular ones that can be considered are Google Keyword Planner, Semrush, Google Search Console, SECockpit, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="add relevant keywords"                ></p><p>Besides finding the keywords, their right placement is also critical. In addition to the podcast name, the keywords can be added to the titles, descriptions, etc. Also, keywords density and variants matter. Make sure not to use the same ones repeatedly in a single paragraph.</p><p>And using keyword variants will increase your reach and will also help you to avoid stuffing. For example, if the keyword is “video editors”, then “video editing”, “video makers”, “editors for videos”, etc., can all be inserted into your transcription. The keywords can also be added to the description and show notes.</p><h3 id="4-Leveraging-podcast-metadata"><a href="#4-Leveraging-podcast-metadata" class="headerlink" title="4. Leveraging podcast metadata"></a>4. Leveraging podcast metadata</h3><p>Metadata helps in providing additional details about your content and is a useful tool for podcast SEO. The metadata appears after the title and provides the podcast episode information, like what the podcast is about, its content, and more.</p><p>Keywords can also be added to the metadata. With these details, the search engines can get a quick understanding of your content and topic and thus help in better search and ranking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="metadata leveraging"                ></p><h3 id="5-Authoritative-quality-content"><a href="#5-Authoritative-quality-content" class="headerlink" title="5.

Authoritative quality content</h3><p>Google always promotes the content that it founds to be authoritative; for this, the Google algorithm should recognize you as the leader in the industry. To match up with the Google algorithm, you need quality content that offers useful and correct information and appeals to the audience.</p><p>So, lay your major focus on the quality content rather than the quantity to establish yourself as the leader. Thus, authoritative quality control is another effective <strong>podcast</strong> SEO technique.</p><h3 id="6-Link-and-promote-on-social-media"><a href="#6-Link-and-promote-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="6.

With your podcasts appearing on multiple channels, chances of getting pulled by Google on search engine results increase.</p><p>You can promote your podcasts on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others and convert them to be fit for YouTube as a downloadable e-book, blog post, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="social media promotion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713565&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Mac： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Make-a-website-or-a-page-for-your-podcast"><a href="#7-Make-a-website-or-a-page-for-your-podcast" class="headerlink" title="7.

So below are the reasons why the feed could not be found.</p><ul><li>If the feed is published for the first time, it might take around 6 days to appear on the Google podcasts.</li><li>Ensure that the feed exists and also at the URL provided.</li><li>Make sure that robots do not block the feed.txt.rule.</li><li>You can also check when Google visited your RSS feed last time.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Check-for-the-RSS-feed-validity"><a href="#2-Check-for-the-RSS-feed-validity" class="headerlink" title="2.

Check for the following.</p><ul><li>Check for validity: To check if the feed is well formed, the RSS validator should be used to validate it using UEL and not the code.</li><li>Check for completeness: The feed should include all the podcast-level tags needed by Google. Also, one episode having the episode tags must be included.</li><li>Feed is not blocked: If there are any blocking tags on your feed, they will not appear on Google. The blocking tags that you need to check are:</li></ul><p><em><a class="link"   href="itunes:block" >itunes:block <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>yes</itunes:block></em></p><p><em><a class="link"   href="googleplay:block" >googleplay:block <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>yes</googleplay:block></em></p><h3 id="3-Google-can-access-the-feed-and-homepage"><a href="#3-Google-can-access-the-feed-and-homepage" class="headerlink" title="3.

Then, when Google sees that additional pages and sites have backlinks to your podcast content, it recognizes you as authoritative and thus pulls it on the search engines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-13.jpg"                      alt="create backlinks"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453721/17020" target="_top" id="1453721"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453721"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453721/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Set-up-Google-Podcast-Manager-1"><a href="#9-Set-up-Google-Podcast-Manager-1" class="headerlink" title="9.

Check for the following.</p><ul><li>Check for validity: To check if the feed is well formed, the RSS validator should be used to validate it using UEL and not the code.</li><li>Check for completeness: The feed should include all the podcast-level tags needed by Google. Also, one episode having the episode tags must be included.</li><li>Feed is not blocked: If there are any blocking tags on your feed, they will not appear on Google.

Thus, they have a professional sense of judging and creating music to implement new ideas, music decors, autotunes, and fade-in and fade-out concepts. In case you do not know what music Fade in and fade out is, then for your information, these are sound effects where the <strong>Fade in-music</strong> effect is usually used at the beginning of the song.</p><p>It begins from absolute silence to smooth melody; the music fade-out effect is generally implemented at the end of the song which slowly goes silent from the melodious tune.</p><p><strong>Why Do People Use Fade In&#x2F;Out Effects?</strong></p><p>Now you might be confused about why musicians use such Fade in and out effects in their songs. The reason is relatively easy to understand; music does not always have any particular source or motive. Thus, it might appear abruptly in your head, out of nowhere. Shaping it and tuning it in the right way is the work of a musician.</p><p>However, it sometimes happens that the professionally composed music might not sound great due to such abrupt endings or starting. This is when such musical effects come to the rescue.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Way 1 - Fade music on PC with Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Way 2 - Use Audacity to Fade Audio</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Fade in&#x2F;out Music on Mac</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Way 1 - Use iMovie to Fade audio on Mac</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Way 2 - Use Apple Music App to Fade Audio</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Fade Music Online</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Fade-Music-on-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Fade-Music-on-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Thus, you can choose the part by dragging the slider you want to edit.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-audio-to-imovie-timeline.jpg"                      alt="drag audio to imovie timeline"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ol><li>Once upon choosing the portion, you will notice the fade handles.

The easy-to-use interface helps even the newbie music editors to find their way through the musical folds of music in the easiest route. However, you can check out the following points for a better understanding of this app:</p><ol><li>After opening the app, you must click on the hamburger sign or the three dots in the upper right-hand corner.</li><li>The settings page would let you add the necessary audio file from your device to the editing platform at once.</li><li>You can enable the crossfade option from the menu box in the settings.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apple-music-fade-audio.jpg"                      alt="apple music fade audio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ol><li>It would lead you to another page on Apple music where you can enable the automatic option for the app to edit the file by adding fade music effects, or you can manually do it all by yourself.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fade-Music-Online-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fade-Music-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Fade Music Online"></a>Part 3. How to Fade Music Online</h2><p>If you think you would have to take the help of any of the above platforms to get your desired Fade in and fade-out effect on the soundtracks, then you are under a misconception. Cleo is one of the online platforms which you can directly use from your browser to <strong>fade out music online</strong>. However, it might confuse the rookie users in the initial stages; with each passing day, they would be able to work on the suitable outcomes from video in no time. The following steps might come in handy:</p><ol><li>You need to add the song to the Clideo platform by uploading it from your dropbox or drive. You can also directly cut it from the above locations.</li><li>Select a particular portion you want to edit in the soundtrack and look for the Fade in and fade-out options from the bottom boxes.</li><li>After applying the fade music effect to the audio file, you can easily export it in your suitable format. Options are given below.</li><li>Save the file in the next step.</li></ol><p>Adding fade music effects is not only about making money or trying to add spine to any average soundtrack. It is about stopping the abrupt ending or initiating a song with complete meaning and a soothing effect on the ears. Fading music is mainly focused on correcting the soundtrack so that the soothing effect remains intact throughout the time. The above article might be helpful to you with all the adequate info now.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"
