Thus, allowing their videos to get higher engagement and views.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-create-a-srt-file-for-video-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-create-a-srt-file-for-video-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?"></a>Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?</h2><p>To create a .srt file for your video on a Windows computer is pretty simple. Yes, you don’t require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.</p><p>That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio&#x2F;dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.</p><p>The stepwise guide illustrated below will walk you through how to create an SRT file for video in Windows;</p><p>Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program. Then create a new file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-1.jpg"                      alt="create a new file"                ></p><p>Step2 Up next, play your video and listen to the first line of the dialogue. Then pause it and write your first subtitle in the note by doing the following;</p><ul><li>Type 1 &gt; under it, write the first Timestamp. The timestamp should be written in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds format as shown below;</li></ul><p><em>1</em></p><ul><li><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></li></ul><p>The times displayed indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the viewer’s screen. Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.</p><p>Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences. Long texts should be broken into multiple subtitles to make them easy for viewers to understand.</p><p>Step4 Repeat steps 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>Below is an example of what an SRT subtitle should look like;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p><em>Hello, and welcome to our presentation.</em></p><p><em>2</em></p><p><em>00:00:012,108 –&gt; 00:00:16,357</em></p><p><em>In this video, we’ll be showing</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle"                ></p><p>Step5 Review the subtitle and edit every error after you’ve completed it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="review subtitle"                ></p><p>Step6 Finally, save the file in .srt format by clicking <strong>‘File’ &gt; Save.</strong> Then under <strong>‘Save As’</strong> enter the file name and add .srt as the preferred extension for your file. Click the ‘Save’ button to complete the task.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-create-an-SRT-file-for-video-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-create-an-SRT-file-for-video-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to create an SRT file for video on Mac?"></a>Part 3: How to create an SRT file for video on Mac?</h2><p>Are you using a Mac computer? Don’t panic, we got you covered with the step-by-step instructions to create a .srt subtitle file and such a computer.</p><p>The process of creating a .srt file for video on Mac is quite similar to .srt file creation on Windows.

But before writing any subtitle captions, play the video whose subtitle you want to write and listen to the first line of the audio.</p><p>After you’ve grabbed the first line, type 1 and write the first Timestamp in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds.</p><p>Here is an example of what you should do;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the times indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the screen.</p><p>Step3 Type your subtitle content in the next line.

Yes, you don’t require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.</p><p>That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio&#x2F;dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.</p><p>The stepwise guide illustrated below will walk you through how to create an SRT file for video in Windows;</p><p>Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program. Then create a new file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-1.jpg"                      alt="create a new file"                ></p><p>Step2 Up next, play your video and listen to the first line of the dialogue. Then pause it and write your first subtitle in the note by doing the following;</p><ul><li>Type 1 &gt; under it, write the first Timestamp. The timestamp should be written in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds format as shown below;</li></ul><p><em>1</em></p><ul><li><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></li></ul><p>The times displayed indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the viewer’s screen. Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.</p><p>Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences. Long texts should be broken into multiple subtitles to make them easy for viewers to understand.</p><p>Step4 Repeat steps 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>Below is an example of what an SRT subtitle should look like;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p><em>Hello, and welcome to our presentation.</em></p><p><em>2</em></p><p><em>00:00:012,108 –&gt; 00:00:16,357</em></p><p><em>In this video, we’ll be showing</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle"                ></p><p>Step5 Review the subtitle and edit every error after you’ve completed it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="review subtitle"                ></p><p>Step6 Finally, save the file in .srt format by clicking <strong>‘File’ &gt; Save.</strong> Then under <strong>‘Save As’</strong> enter the file name and add .srt as the preferred extension for your file.

It’s really free to utilize one of the most well-liked ones. You want to make your voice better for your next audio production, right? You most likely searched the internet and came across some cool audio program named Audacity. Mix tracks or add effects to your recordings to edit your audio utilizing the cut, copy, and paste tools with limitless undo capability.</p><p>For audio analysis applications, Audacity additionally has an integrated amplitude-envelope editor, a customizable spectrogram mode, and a frequency-analysis window. The ideal way to get started in the realm of audio editing is using Audacity. It was created by volunteers using open-source software. With Audacity, you can do a lot of things, such trim files to make them shorter, take away background noise, cut out silence, change volume, and more. The drop-down menu located underneath the sound level meters on top allows you to rapidly choose between the numerous audio sources.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Crossfade"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Crossfade?"></a>Part 1. What is Crossfade?</h2><p>Crossfading process allows two sounds to segue smoothly into one another. Crossfading is an audio effect that is often used in audio engineering to merge two or more sounds in a song gradually rather than suddenly. This method is mostly used to prevent any abrupt silences between two songs, which might disturb listeners. As a result of the development of the computer-based digital audio editor, crossfading became more straightforward.</p><p>When you cross fade music, you cause one piece of audio to fade out—the sound gradually vanishes—at the precise same moment as another piece of audio fades in—the sound gradually manifests. This effect produces a seamless transition between the two songs without any abrupt pauses or quiet in between. The volume of audio in the source files is the sole restriction on the duration of the fade in a digital editor that supports crossfading between two or more files.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982485">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982485.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982485">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982485.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982485%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982485/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Before the first event completely vanishes into the second, the crossfade gradually transitions by overlaying the events at the transition point so that both are seen or heard at the same time. Using Audacity, it’s easy to reduce some of the background noise in your audio track. You must create a noise profile to do this. We’ve put up a helpful guide on how to use Audacity to enhance your audio productions.</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Audacity Crossfade</strong>:</p><p>Step1 Select File, Import, and Audio from the menu.

If the screen resolution is 3840 X 2160 then you are looking at the 4K Ultra HD TV, anything short of that is no longer a 4K TV. With TVs that have a resolution as high as this, you can be sure that all 4K or HDR content is designed to fit perfectly on its screen, while things are a little bit different with 4K projectors.</p><p> Many of the 4K projectors are not exactly that because they offer a pseudo 4K resolution through pixel interpolation. To make things even worse, most of the projectors offer only the ability to read and display 4K content, through native Full HD image sensor. If you are not looking to buy a high-end 4K projector make sure that the item you wish to purchase has a true 4K capability.</p><h4 id="2-Brightness-and-Contrast"><a href="#2-Brightness-and-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="2.  Brightness and Contrast"></a>2.  Brightness and Contrast</h4><p> If you ever watched a movie in a cinema you know that projectors need dark rooms to deliver their best performance. The image brightness, 4K projectors designed for home entertainment, can deliver is largely dependent on the light conditions of the room. But even in the perfect conditions of a darkened room, most projectors can’t generate the same level of the projection brightness as a 4K TV.</p><p> On the other hand, most projectors have overall better contrast ratios than the one generated on the screen of a 4K HDR TV, with the exception of TVs that feature OLED technology.</p><h4 id="3-Colors"><a href="#3-Colors" class="headerlink" title="3.  Colors"></a>3.  Colors</h4><p> Projector vs 4K TV dilemma becomes slightly more complicated when it comes to colors since both 4K TVs and 4K HDR projectors deliver stunningly vibrant colors. In addition, both of these device types are capable of displaying 90% of the HDR color space and cover more than 1.07 billion color shades.</p><p> Even though the colors look more vivid on 4K TVs solely because of its huge brightness advantage over the projectors, 4K HDR projectors still offer a somewhat wider color space and coverage.</p><h4 id="4-Picture-Display"><a href="#4-Picture-Display" class="headerlink" title="4.  Picture Display"></a>4.  Picture Display</h4><p> There is no question that projectors have a clear advantage over TVs when it comes to picture display. You can adjust the size of the picture by changing the projector’s distance from the surface you want to project the pictures to and you can choose on which surface you want to project pictures. Projection screens usually do the trick, although there might be some research involved related to the room characteristics since you need to know the dimensions of the wall and the room size so you can place the projector at the optimum distance from the screen.</p><p> With 4K TVs, you may not get a huge picture display, but the conditions you have to meet in order to enjoy 4K images are much simpler.</p><h4 id="5-Audio"><a href="#5-Audio" class="headerlink" title="5.  Audio"></a>5.  Audio</h4><p> All 4K TVs have their own speakers that are more than enough to enjoy the 4K footage you want to watch on your TV. Some models of 4K projectors can have speakers, but because of the position of the projector, they are often behind and above you which doesn’t bode well for the audio performance. Most 4K projectors require a setup that includes several external speakers to enable an enjoyable viewing experience.</p><p> Furthermore, 4K TV’s are much easier to connect with audio devices and you can control the setup with the TV’s remote which makes your home entertainment experience much more comfortable.</p><h4 id="6-Installation"><a href="#6-Installation" class="headerlink" title="6.  Installation"></a>6.  Installation</h4><p> Setting up a 4K TV is very simple. All you need to do is to find an elevated flat surface on which you wish to place the TV, plug it into the nearest electrical socket and turn it on. If you wish to connect your TV to your desktop computer or your stereo system you might need to get a few more cables, but that is where your troubles end.</p><p> Unfortunately the same cannot be said for 4K projectors because you first need to find the right distance from the projection screen, then you must connect it to a computer or video playback device and finally you need to adjust picture sharpness that is directly related to the distance from the projection screen. In terms of simplicity and the amount of time needed for installation the projector VS 4K TV, dilemma seems to be non-existent</p><h4 id="7-Viewing-experience"><a href="#7-Viewing-experience" class="headerlink" title="7.  Viewing experience"></a>7.  Viewing experience</h4><p> For some people, at least the experience of having a 4K projector in your home may be reminiscent of watching a movie in the theater. Also, the projected images might be lighter on the eyes, but if you are thinking about getting a 4K projector bear in mind that you’ll need additional equipment to have the best possible viewing experience.</p><p> 4K TV’s provide less immersive experience than the 4K projectors, however, with so many models available with the size of more than 60 inches that provide crisp and vivid colors the experience of watching a movie or any other 4K content is nothing short of superb.</p><h4 id="8-Cost"><a href="#8-Cost" class="headerlink" title="8.  Cost"></a>8.  Cost</h4><p> 4K projectors vs 4K TVs comparison is not hard to make when it comes to price because projectors are much more expensive. Even the Full HD, 2K projectors that can play 4K content cost between $3.000 and 5.000$, while home entertainment projectors with native 4K resolution don’t cost less than $10.000.</p><p> 4K TVs are much more affordable since you can purchase a new 60-inch model for approximately $2.000. The image quality of 4K projectors simply doesn’t justify their price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144283/7443" target="_top" id="2144283">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144283" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144283/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Winner-4K-TV"><a href="#Winner-4K-TV" class="headerlink" title="Winner - 4K TV"></a>Winner - 4K TV</h2><p> The high price, relatively complicated setup, additional equipment that is required for a perfect home entertainment experience make the 4K projection VS 4K TV showdown incredibly unfair because 4K TVs are simply better in each and every of these aspects. Perhaps the best option is to have both a projector and a 4K TV, but if your budget is limited and you can’t spare $3000 or much more for a 4K projector, we suggest that TV is much better option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-3-tactics-converting-pins-to-audio-clips/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Top 3 Tactics Converting Pins to Audio Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-premium-cloud-apps-for-android-the-most-reliable/"><u>[New] In 2024, Premium Cloud Apps for Android The Most Reliable</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-video-magic-begins-macbooks-webcam-guide/"><u>[New] In 2024, Video Magic Begins MacBook's Webcam Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-clear-image-purchases-no-more-watermarks/"><u>[Updated] Clear Image Purchases No More Watermarks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-new-frontiers-with-vr-game-engines/"><u>[Updated] Exploring New Frontiers with VR Game Engines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-guffaw-generator-cyborg-comic-coders/"><u>[Updated] Guffaw Generator Cyborg Comic Coders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capture-stunning-videos-on-iphone-8-pro-tips-for-quality-shootings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Capture Stunning Videos on iPhone 8 Pro Tips for Quality Shootings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-micro-film-narrative-blueprint/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Micro-Film Narrative Blueprint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unraveling-freeze-frames-in-photobooth-recordings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unraveling Freeze Frames in Photobooth Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-secrets-perfecting-motion-blur-in-photoshop/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Secrets Perfecting Motion Blur in Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discover-the-best-snapchat-video-edits-on-android-and-iphone/"><u>2024 Approved Discover the Best Snapchat Video Edits on Android and iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/led-steps-to-supercharge-your-youtube-audio-content-for-2024/"><u>Detailed Steps to Supercharge Your YouTube Audio Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/humor-hub-iphones-galore-for-2024/"><u>Humor Hub IPhones Galore for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-infinix-smart-8-hd-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Can I use iTools gpx file to catch the rare Pokemon On Infinix Smart 8 HD | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/kickstart-your-linux-adventure-with-steam-unlock-infinite-game-possibebies-in-one-easy-installation-zdnet/"><u>Kickstart Your Linux Adventure with Steam: Unlock Infinite Game Possibebies in One Easy Installation | ZDNET</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/stop-valorant-from-crashing-effective-solutions-for-pc-gamers/"><u>Stop Valorant From Crashing - Effective Solutions for PC Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/mka-aac-moovavis/"><u>오픈소스 내부 MKA 파일을 자유성 방식 AAC로 전환하세요 - Moovavis 도구</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Explore Real-World Hidden Gems Through Location Services"></a>Where’s the Magic? Explore Real-World Hidden Gems Through Location Services</h2><p>The <strong>Magic Call voice changer app</strong> is a mobile app that can make prank calls by changing your voice into male, female, cartoon, and more. In addition, the <strong>Magic Call app</strong> allows you to customize the background of your calls with sound effects like rain, traffic, music concert, rain, and more. Just select a contact and start your Magic Call. But as good as it comes, many users complain that Magic Call doesn’t work as intended. Is that true? We dive into the app to bring you this first-hand experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working"><a href="#Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?"></a>Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/magic-call-voice-changer-app-1.jpg"                      alt="magic call voice changer app on app store"                ></p><p>So, does <a class="link"   href="http://www.magiccall.co/" >Magic Call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work, or is it just another over-hyped app on Play Store and App Store? For starters, the fact that the app is on Play Store and App Store means it has been tested to ensure users have a trusted experience. However, you’ll notice that the app is rated 2.3 stars on Play Store, which is far from reassuring.</p><p>Some reviewers often complain that Magic Call doesn’t run properly. For example, one review claims the app hangs for at least an hour after clicking the “Continue” button. Another common problem with Magic Call is the failure to send the OTS SMS to the number you provide. Some reviewers also claim that the app doesn’t send fake calls, although they can hear their phone ringing.</p><p>In our first-hand review of the app, we noticed that the app couldn’t send an OTP to our phone number. However, we contacted their support, and this was sorted out almost instantly. Besides that, the app works fine, although with limited choices of voice effects. In addition, Magic Call gives new users 2 minutes of free call time, after which you’ll have to purchase call credits. Overall, it’s a decent app, although better alternatives exist.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call"><a href="#Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call"></a>Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call</h2><p>To avoid the troubles that come with Magic Call, here are some highly rated alternatives to consider:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880940/19272" target="_top" id="1880940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880940/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App"><a href="#1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App" class="headerlink" title="1.

With so many advanced technologies, many popular producers are launching impressive features rich models with slightly varying price tags. Some of the popular names in this competitors list include Xiaoyi, H9, EKEN and GoPro etc. They are often rated as high class camera producers but when we think about budget friendly options then brands like ThiEye and SJCam show their best performance with all good features.</p><p> Both of these companies have launched so many advanced cameras into market within last few months so buyers can often feel confused for the right choice. If you are also finding such difficulties in selection then it is good to read the article below; hope it will make things easier for you.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Specification-Comparison"><a href="#Specification-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Specification Comparison"></a>Specification Comparison</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Parameters</th><th>SJ6 Legend</th><th>ThiEye T5e</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Price</td><td>159 USD</td><td>179.99 USD</td></tr><tr><td>Video Resolutions</td><td>4K @ 24fps interpolated; 2K @ 30fps; 1080@ 60fps; 720P@ 120&#x2F;60&#x2F;30fps;</td><td>4K @ 30fps (native), 2.8K 30fps, 2.5K 60fps, 1440P 60fps, 1080P 120&#x2F;60&#x2F;30fps, 720P 240 &#x2F;120fps</td></tr><tr><td>Image Sensor</td><td>16MP Panasonic MN34120PA</td><td>12MP Sony IMX117</td></tr><tr><td>Waterproof</td><td>30 m (with case)</td><td>60 m (with case)</td></tr><tr><td>Chipset</td><td>Novatek 96660</td><td>Ambarella A12S</td></tr><tr><td>Loop Recording</td><td>3min&#x2F;5min&#x2F;10min</td><td>1&#x2F;2&#x2F;3&#x2F;5min</td></tr><tr><td>External Mic Support</td><td>Yes</td><td>&#x2F;</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>1000mAh</td><td>1100mAh</td></tr><tr><td>Fisheye Correction</td><td>Yes</td><td>N&#x2F;a</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>2’’ LCD Touchscreen</td><td>2.0’’ built-in TFT LCD</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Max. 128GB</td><td>Max. 64GB</td></tr><tr><td>Image Stabilization</td><td>Gyro Stabilization</td><td>EIS</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>59×21.1×41 mm</td><td>61 x 42 x 23mm(L x W x D)</td></tr><tr><td>Recording Format</td><td>.mp4 or MOV  codec</td><td>.mp4  codec</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>82 grams</td><td>78.2 grams</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Remote Control</td><td>Yes</td><td>N&#x2F;a</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity &amp; Ports</td><td>MiniUSB Port; HDMI ; SD Card Slot; Wi-Fi;</td><td>Micro USB, HDMI, Micro SD card Slot, Wi-Fi</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094479/7443" target="_top" id="2094479">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094479/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Hardware-Comparison"><a href="#Hardware-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Comparison"></a>Hardware Comparison</h2><h4 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h4><p> If we try to make difference on the basis of design then probably you will find it too difficult to rate one camera good over another because both of these are almost same. You will find 2” LCD screen on back panel of both these cameras but the difference lies in their performance as SJ6 possess touch screen and T5e is simple non touch display. SJ6 model also includes one front display screen with 0.96” dimension; it helps to display information regarding modes, battery and camera status.</p><p> Moving towards the ports, you will find many common hardware connectivity options on both these devices with USB port, SDCard Slot and HDMI port but the major difference lies in presence of MicroUSB port in ThiEye T5e whereas SJ6 possess Mini USB. If you want to record footage with hands-free mode then both cameras can offer you easy tripod mounting options.</p><h4 id="Chipset-and-Storage"><a href="#Chipset-and-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Chipset and Storage"></a>Chipset and Storage</h4><p> As already discussed, SJ6 Legend extends support to external storage space via its SD card slot so you can easily expand storage space up to 128GB. However, this external SDcard slot is also present in ThiEye T5e device but that can be expanded only up to 64GB. As these cameras are designed to capture high resolution photographs and videos so it becomes essential to have more storage space hence SJ6 can be announced winner in this battle.</p><p> You will find Novatek 96660 processor inside SJ6 Legend whereas ThiEye T5e is containing Ambarella A12LS75 processor unit. Performance of Ambarella processor is proven to be much better as compared to Novatek but it can show little poor results when camera is operated continuously for longer duration.</p><h4 id="Camera-Lens"><a href="#Camera-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Camera Lens"></a>Camera Lens</h4><p> You will find 2.5mm camera lens in T5e module whereas SJ6 contains 17.5 mm lens that offers impressive sharp contrast. With these advanced lens support, SJ6 is capable enough to provide eye catching results even in low light areas. If we talk about coverage angle then SJ6 is able to cover lesser field with its 166 degree wide angle lens but your footage will get improved in focus with 170 degree wide range of T5e.</p><h4 id="Accessories"><a href="#Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Accessories"></a>Accessories</h4><p> Once you receive your T5e action camera following things will come out of its box:</p><ul><li>Camera.</li><li>Pack of accessories.</li><li>Wiper and quick start guide.</li><li>2 Batteries of 1100mAh.</li><li>One waterproof casing.</li></ul><p> One the other side, the list for in box accessories in case of SJ6 is large enough:</p><ul><li>Camera and manual</li><li>Waterproof case and plastic frame for safety.</li><li>Rotating curved and flat mounts.</li><li>Handlebar mount</li><li>Flat mount and screw mount.</li><li>Wiper and wire</li><li>2 stickers.</li></ul><h4 id="Battery"><a href="#Battery" class="headerlink" title="Battery"></a>Battery</h4><p> You will find a 1000mAh battery inside SJ6 cam unit but this value goes little high in case of T5e that contains 1050mAh. You will find this rating difference quite small but it adds up little value to overall performance. As you can record 4K videos with native details in case of T5e so it will naturally consume more power and it ultimately reduces the overall battery life. But the great news is that you will find two batteries inside T5e box so it can serve you for longer time if you have charged them both.</p><h4 id="Waterproof"><a href="#Waterproof" class="headerlink" title="Waterproof"></a>Waterproof</h4><p> With IPx8 casing, you can take T5e underwater up to 60 meters with additional protective casing. Most of the underwater shooting lovers prefer to buy this camera unit due to its impressive underwater footage recording. It will find impressive color distribution on screen for every recording. On the other side, SJ6 is designed with special Dive with Me feature so that users can go under water up to 30 meters with ease.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-and-Performance-Comparison"><a href="#Features-and-Performance-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance Comparison"></a>Features and Performance Comparison</h2><h4 id="Video-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#Video-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video and Image Quality"></a>Video and Image Quality</h4><p> T5e is capable enough to capture Ultra HD videos with 30 fps frame rate where users can make selections for two formats as 16:9 and 3:4. You can also enjoy time-lapse video recording with Te5 where several photos are developed with interval adjustment between 1 to 60 seconds. Its electronic image stabilization ability results much smoother results for pixel distribution but it can serve you only up to 1080px. Professionals reveal that it is much easier to improve T5e footage via post processing methods. 4k videos in case of T5e can be captured at 25 as well as 30 fps rating. The stills are captured with 12MP rating.</p><p> SJCam offers 4K recording abilities but it is not actual 4K, the technology is interpolated 4K that means; the camera itself produces 2k content and then additional 2k pixels are added to footage with internal processes.

It allows you to fully control the intensity and color saturation of the green screen. You are free to light your subject as you wish and avoid any shadows falling on the background. So typically two or more lights are used to light the green screen. Adjust the light positions and filters until you get the satisfying result. If your subject is human, it requires 6-10 feet between your subject and the background.</p><p>Don’t throw too much light onto the green background. That will create hotspots and “green spill” on the subject and make the key less effective. The key to lighting a green screen is consistency – create a single, consistent shade of color across the entire screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/green-screen-lighting-tips.png"                      alt="Lighting tips in shooting a Green Screen Video"                ></p><p>Check out our picks of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the best lighting equipment for shooting videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2Camera-tips-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video"><a href="#2Camera-tips-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="2Camera tips in shooting a Green Screen Video"></a>2Camera tips in shooting a Green Screen Video</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/green-screen-mistake-6.png"                      alt="Camera tips in shooting a Green Screen Video"                ></p><p>When lighting your key surface, make sure the bounce light is not directed at the camera (as shown in the image above). For example, if your camera faces the key surface directly, set your lights at 45 degree angles to the key surface. This will ensure that the bounce light bounces toward the other light and not at the camera.</p><p>Also choose carefully the camera as some cameras are better to shoot green screen video, especially if you are shooting something with a bit of movement. Then shoot your video as HD quality video (720p or higher) and save in a format your green screen software can import.</p><p>When shooting the green screen video, it’s of great importance to keep the camera very still and a tripod is necessary for this purpose. The simplest shot is to captures the whole body in the center of the cloth so that none of the peripheral edges of the room can been seen. Another general rule is that it’s better to lose legs in a shot than the head of an individual. Although sometimes it’s essential to film a perspective that break these rules, many problems can be overcome in the editing process.</p><p>Looking for some best cameras for shooting green screen video?

Perhaps one of the simplest mistakes that many people make with green screen video shooting is actually wearing green clothing. If you are wearing clothing or clothing that has buttons or accents that are a similar color green as your selected background green, the image that you project onto the green screen in post-editing will also get picked up by these accents on your clothing or by the clothing itself. This is great if you want to cut off part of an actor’s body, but not so professional if you are trying to make an actor appear in a realistic scene.</p><h4 id="4-Wrinkles-problem-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video"><a href="#4-Wrinkles-problem-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="4 Wrinkles problem in shooting a Green Screen Video"></a>4 Wrinkles problem in shooting a Green Screen Video</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/green-screen-mistake-2.png"                      alt="Wrinkles problem in shooting a Green Screen Video"                ></p><p>Wrinkles in your screen can actually lead to heavy shadows and distorted image quality in your green screen video. If you regularly fold your green screen for storage it’s very important that you take an iron out and flat negative green screen to prevent shadows and distortions with your background image. This is a step that many skip over but it’s important to have a high-quality green screen without wrinkles and folds that cause shadows.</p><h4 id="5-Motion-blur-problem-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video"><a href="#5-Motion-blur-problem-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="5 Motion blur problem in shooting a Green Screen Video"></a>5 Motion blur problem in shooting a Green Screen Video</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/green-screen-mistake-4.png"                      alt="Motion blur problem in shooting a Green Screen Video"                ></p><p>If you are planning on shooting a high action scene in front of a green screen with a camera that only has lower shutter speeds, you can run into real problems. When using a camera with a lower shutter speed consider doing action shots in slow motion or getting subjects to not make any sudden movements in front of the green screen. Motion blur from someone moving rapidly on camera in front of a green screen can really ruin the scene and ruin the realism of the scene. Alternately you could also consider renting a high shutter speed camera to avoid this motion blur if you do plan on shooting a lot of action scenes. Ultimately this is something that you will need to test for yourself before shooting a green screen video, so that you can get a feel for how much action your camera can handle with a green screen without motion blur.</p><p>Wanna adding a fake camera shake effect to your video?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Achieve-High-Definition-Quality-with-Video-Enhancer-2-2-Tutorial"><a href="#Achieve-High-Definition-Quality-with-Video-Enhancer-2-2-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Achieve High-Definition Quality with Video Enhancer 2.2 Tutorial"></a>Achieve High-Definition Quality with Video Enhancer 2.2 Tutorial</h2><p>We’ve all experienced moments when the quality of a video isn’t as good as we’d like it to be. This is especially true; an unsteady hand, poor lighting, or low-quality technology can prevent all damage to a video.</p><p>You’re in luck if you’ve ever wondered how to improve video quality. We’re going to look over the finest video quality enhancers today. Many video enhancers have been launched so far, and you might find it difficult to choose one for you. Let’s begin:</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Video-enhancer-2-2"><a href="#Video-enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Video enhancer 2.2"></a>Video enhancer 2.2</h2><p>Video Enhancer is an application that uses the Super Resolution approach to boost video resolution. Super Resolution is a clever video upsizing method that uses information from neighboring frames to upsize the current frame. It gathers data. Therefore the more sequential frames processed, the greater the quality.</p><p>If the image in your video doesn’t change too quickly, information from multiple frames can be combined to create a larger image, showing details that would otherwise be concealed. However, no regular image resize&#x2F;resample techniques can achieve this quality because there isn’t enough information in one frame.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2"><a href="#How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?"></a>How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?</h3><p>Video Enhancers allow you to:</p><ul><li>Increase the resolution of your video with the Video Super-Resolution approach, which gives incredible quality by leveraging information from prior frames. At the same time, other resize methods only use information from one current frame. In addition, you may now convert SD video to HD!</li><li>Use VirtualDub’s hundreds of video filters to perform anything you want with your video, including deinterlacing, denoising, deshaking, color correction, sharpening, and visual effects.</li></ul><p>Because all filters and codecs function in independent threads, Video Enhancer is much faster than VirtualDub.</p><ul><li>Open any video that can be played on your system and re-compress it using any video codec (DirectShow, DMO, or Video for Windows) that you have installed.</li></ul><p>However, the step-by-step on how to use Video Enhancer 2.2</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the file</strong></p><p>Download Video Enhancer 2.2 and launch the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-1.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Once you have launched the software, import the file by clicking on ‘Browse’ to enhance video resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Edit the file</strong></p><p>After uploading the video file, click on ‘Add a filter,’ and a pop-up window shows various editing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-2.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>You can create chains with any number of VirtualDub and Super Resolution filters to apply to your video in the Advanced user interface mode. You can filter your video before, after, in between, or even instead of scaling.</p><p>With over a hundred VirtualDub filters, you can edit your video, including deinterlace, denoise, deshake, color correction, visual effects, etc. Video Enhancer will most likely recognize your filters if you have VirtualDub installed.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Improve Video Resolution:</strong></p><p>Once you are done editing the video, close the pop-up window and click on ‘Add Super Resolution Resize’ and change the video resolution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-3.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Save the edited video file</strong></p><p>Click the Save video to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome. You can also change the configuration of the output file by selecting your preferred video and audio compressing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-4.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Video Enhancer will scan your system for 32-bit video and audio compressors and provide them in drop-down lists for you to choose from. If you have codecs from Video Enhancer’s favored list, it will advise which codec to use and at what bitrate. The recommended bitrate is determined by the final video resolution and the codec. After that, it displays its recommendations in the text; you must select the codecs and set the bitrate in its settings to finish the process.</p><h2 id="Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video"><a href="#Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video" class="headerlink" title="Alternative ways to enhance video"></a>Alternative ways to enhance video</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016134/19272" target="_top" id="2016134">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016134" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016134/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora"></a>1. Filmora</h3><p>Compatibility: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is, without a doubt, the best video editor on the market, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>In the Filmora video editor, you’ll find some professional tools to help you increase video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort. Apart from the features that allow you to adjust video rotation effortlessly, this program is one of the most dependable.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import media files</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-5.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Enhance video quality</strong></p><p>Drag &amp; drop all the media files onto the timeline tracks after being imported into the application. Right-click on the media clip you want to improve and select “Edit.” Rotate, crop, speed, and adjust are just a few fundamental options. You may quickly adjust the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue from this menu. It is less difficult to edit audio. Select the Audio column and adjust the settings as desired. You may change the output volume, fade in, fade out, and pitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-6.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export and Share video</strong></p><p>Click the Play button to see a preview of the new video; once you’ve improved the video quality, select Export to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome. The Format tab allows you to encode the video into several video formats, or the Device tab allows you to export the video to common mobile pictures and portable devices. Finally, go to the DVD tab if you wish to burn a DVD. Additionally, you can post it online using the YouTube option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-7.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMovie"><a href="#2-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="2. iMovie"></a>2. iMovie</h3><p>Compatibility: macOS, iOS</p><p>Instead of paying hundreds of dollars on video editing tools, Mac users can use iMovie to edit their videos. The best thing is that the software works on iPhones, iPads, and Apple laptops, allowing you to edit your footage as soon as you take it.</p><p>iMovie supports 4K films and makes the editing process enjoyable and simple. You only need to arrange your clips on the timeline, choose background music, make opening titles and closing credits, or add interesting visual effects. Then, your videos are ready to be shared with the public.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Navigate to the project browser and choose the video clip you wish to modify. To begin the resizing process, click the crop button. You can also press the R key on your keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-8.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 2: Drag and resize your movie by dragging and repositioning the green rectangle. Stop pressing the resize button after you’re happy with the final size.</p><p>Step 3: View the video on the viewer to see how it looks after resizing.</p><h3 id="3-HDConvert"><a href="#3-HDConvert" class="headerlink" title="3.

Additionally, the platform provides a variety of export options, including the ability to change the resolution of your video files. There are no file size restrictions, so that you can upload any file to HDconvert, regardless of its size. However, huge video files may take some time to upload.</p><p>After the upload is complete, you can select various video resolutions, ranging from 240p to UHD 4K. If you wish to export your video files in Full HD, Ultra HD, or 4K resolution, you’ll need to upgrade to the premium edition of HDconvert. Furthermore, use the free version of HDconvert to modify the resolution of your videos. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to change the default  video codec to  video codec.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Go to HDconvert.com and press the button in the center to begin converting a file right away.</p><p>Step 2: To continue, upload a video file and select MP4 as the desired video format.</p><p>Step 3: Select Full HD 1080p as the output video quality if you’re on the premium plan. Aside from that, you can only convert video to HD 720P.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-10.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 4: Once the standard video has been converted to HD, download the video to your device as soon as possible because the download URL will expire in 24 hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-11.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><h3 id="4-InShot"><a href="#4-InShot" class="headerlink" title="4.

The Most Affordable Mini Desktop with Snapdragon X Elite Chipset - Secure Yours Today Through Preorder</h2><p>In an interesting turn of events, the first device boasting the highest-end version of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chipset isn’t even a laptop. It’s a Mini PC in the form of an official Dev Kit, which undercuts (<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-1069194734322795598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-computer-laptops/new-inspiron-14-plus-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-7441-laptop/useichbts7441hcjp?ref=variantstack" >or at least matches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) the price of even the lower-end Snapdragon X Plus laptops, and it’s set for a full launch on August 23rd, though it’s also already available for pre-order on<a class="link"   href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/c8380-12c-mp-32g/thundercomm" >Arrow.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for just $899 USD.</p><p> We just reviewed a Snapdragon X Elite laptop— the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/dell-xps-13-9345-review" >Dell XPS 13 9345 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — and that unit retails for $1299, which is about $400 pricier for the laptop form factor.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Dev-Kit-for-Windows-Specifications"><a href="#Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Dev-Kit-for-Windows-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Specifications"></a>Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>SoC</strong> : Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite X-1E-00-1DE, specs divided between CPU, GPU, and NPU below</li><li><strong>CPU</strong> : Qualcomm Oryon CPU with 12 cores rated at up to 3.8 GHz, or 4.3 with Dual Core Boost; 42 MB cache</li><li><strong>GPU</strong> : Qualcomm Adreno GPU rated for 4.6 Teraflops</li><li><strong>NPU</strong> : Qualcomm Hexagon NPU rated for 45 TOPS</li><li><strong>RAM</strong> : 32GB LPDDR5X RAM</li><li><strong>Storage</strong> : 512 GB “Fast” NVMe SSD</li><li><strong>OS</strong> : Windows 11</li><li><strong>Size</strong> : 199 mm x 175 mm x 35 mm, or 8 x 7 x 1.3 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong> : 970 grams, or ~2.1 lbs</li><li><strong>I&#x2F;O</strong> : 3 USB4 Type-C ports (1 Front), 2 USB 3.2 Type-A ports; 1 Ethernet port; 1 HDMI port; 1 3.5mm audio port</li></ul><p> So, who is this Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite Mini PC really for? As advertised, it’s targeted at developers, which makes sense— if you’re hoping to target ARM-native software for the X Elite chips hitting the laptop or want to properly test and tweak your x86-native software for use with those devices, this seems like the way to go. But if the enhanced AI features (<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/live/copilot-pc-launch-2024" >Copilot+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) of the Snapdragon X Elite happen to hold particularly high appeal to you and your workflows, that’s another reason this piece of kit could be compelling.</p><p> For gaming purposes, we definitely wouldn’t recommend the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite platform at this time. While it’s true that some games work and even the new image scaling options added just for Windows ARM and these devices are compelling, the overall gaming performance and compatibility of Snapdragon X Elite just isn’t competitive with x86 gaming laptops at this time. Other iGPUs—<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-suffer-compatibility-issues-with-many-games#xenforo-comments-3848147" >even_Intel_ iGPUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — provide a much better experience.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> But it’s not all doom and gloom in the world of Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops — or Mini PCs in this case — as long as you have the requisite monitor and peripherals to get it up and running. You generally have a pretty usable version of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/windows-11" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here, and a number of productivity and creative applications that will work perfectly fine.

It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos.

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_Jk8a-_2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw_wcB" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie.

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_Jk8a-_2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw_wcB" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144289/7443" target="_top" id="2144289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144289/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ol><li>That should do it!

It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528700/16446" target="_top" id="1528700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528700/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-engaging-your-audience-the-art-of-interacting-with-subscribers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Engaging Your Audience The Art of Interacting with Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-evasive-action-to-escape-the-shadowban-snare/"><u>[New] Evasive Action to Escape the Shadowban Snare</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-vivid-visuals-selecting-the-best-11-tutorials/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting Vivid Visuals Selecting the Best 11 Tutorials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-deciding-on-the-ultimate-virtual-gaming-platform/"><u>2024 Approved Deciding on the Ultimate Virtual Gaming Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-launch-free-dvd-playback-capabilities-on-windowsmac-laptops/"><u>2024 Approved Launch Free DVD Playback Capabilities on Windows/Mac Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transforming-everyday-alerts-how-to-create-customizable-tones-on-android-phones/"><u>2024 Approved Transforming Everyday Alerts How to Create Customizable Tones on Android Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-types-and-designations-in-ua-world/"><u>2024 Approved Types & Designations in UA World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-the-potential-of-still-photos-through-video-creation-in-pixiz/"><u>2024 Approved Unlock the Potential of Still Photos Through Video Creation in Pixiz</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/globetrotting-without-sacrificing-animal-bond-time/"><u>Globetrotting Without Sacrificing Animal Bond Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-apple-id-without-phone-number-from-iphone-15-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Apple ID without Phone Number From iPhone 15 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/streamlined-qanda-guide-for-attractive-podcasts-for-2024/"><u>Streamlined Q&A Guide for Attractive Podcasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/the-next-step-after-vlc-top-media-players-reviewed-for-2024/"><u>The Next Step After VLC - Top Media Players Reviewed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-fcpx-skin-smoothing-hack-no-plugins-needed-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate FCPX Skin Smoothing Hack No Plugins Needed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unleash-the-power-of-ai-8-exceptional-chatgpt-extensions-tailored-for-health-and-wellness-progress/"><u>Unleash the Power of AI: 8 Exceptional ChatGPT Extensions Tailored for Health & Wellness Progress</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

We capture multiple images of the same subject or a scene with slightly different exposure and then mix all the images into a final perfect photograph.</p><p>A portrait is one of the most liked genres of photography, especially on the occasions of weddings, get-togethers, meet-ups, and many more. A good portrait photograph can capture a person’s detailed personality and emotions.</p><p>The camera can perform fantastic functions, but it is still a machine at the end of the day, and its sensors have limitations. But by the HDR technique, you can create a scene closer to what the human eye sees.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn how to shoot and create impressive HDR portraits, whether a beginner or a professional. We have written about creating both still and moving HDR portraits in an easy way.</p><p>People often find it challenging to shoot a perfect HDR photograph from a phone camera. In this tutorial, we will answer some common questions on how to create an impressive HDR portrait. So let’s get started.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Still HDR Portraits</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Some Useful Tips to Remember</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">HDR Effects on Phone Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Moving HDR Portraits?</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot HDR Portraits?"></a>How to Shoot HDR Portraits?</h2><p>HDR portraits are best captured when your subject is still and the camera is also fixed on a tripod. So first, we will talk about how to shoot still portraits and then moving portraits.</p><h3 id="Still-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#Still-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Still HDR Portraits"></a>Still HDR Portraits</h3><p>You can create a high-quality HDR portrait by following these simple steps.</p><h5 id="Step1Camera-Setting"><a href="#Step1Camera-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Step1Camera Setting"></a>Step1Camera Setting</h5><p>The first and most crucial part of your camera setting is to choose between two modes, i.e., manual or aperture mode. We have compared these two below so you can choose whichever way fits your situation.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Manual mode</strong></th><th><strong>Aperture Mode</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>In manual mode, you can control both aperture and shutter speed and select any desired value.</td><td>In this mode, you just have to select your desired aperture value, like <em>f</em>&#x2F;2.0 or <em>f</em>&#x2F;1.8, and the camera will automatically pick the suitable shutter speed.</td></tr><tr><td>It can be used when the lighting conditions are intense and constant, and you have plenty of time to think and adjust the exposure.</td><td>Useful when the light conditions are changing rapidly.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Gaming-on-the-Green-Comprehenive-Review-of-Vegas-Pro-2021"><a href="#Gaming-on-the-Green-Comprehenive-Review-of-Vegas-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="Gaming on the Green: Comprehenive Review of Vegas Pro 2021"></a>Gaming on the Green: Comprehenive Review of Vegas Pro 2021</h2><p>A fresh take on the traditional video editing program is VEGAS Pro 19. New name, new features, but is VEGAS still the same under the surface? VEGAS has always involved some dice-rolling. In our evaluation of VEGAS Movie Studio 17, the video editor received a definite 2.5-star average (the same goes for VEGAS Movie Studio 15).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vegas-pro-19.jpg"                      alt="vegas pro 19"                ></p><p>We criticized the software, saying that it was “not as good as the VEGAS name would have you believe.” Although some tools are incorporated in a very brilliant, innovative, and intuitive way, on the whole it feels too restricting away from your most basic demands. Your alternatives are restricted, or excessively concealed, overly complex, or unclear.</p><p>However, we are all still developing. In the same way, VEGAS Pro 19 offers a number of new tools that are suited for both novice and experienced video editors, even though it isn’t considered to be one of the best alternatives to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Color-grading"><a href="#Color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Color grading"></a>Color grading</h2><p>Changing the interface’s colors to make the experience better when editing is one thing, but it’s also good to</p><p>see that actual color correction has been improved as well.</p><p>The Grading Panel has been redesigned, like thinner looking range-limited color wheels, which give you more</p><p>control over the adjustments you’re making.</p><p>VEGAS also comes with 40 LUTs, and expanded individual R, G, B curves, among others, making color correction work more precise and enjoyable than before.</p><h2 id="Track-effects"><a href="#Track-effects" class="headerlink" title="Track effects"></a>Track effects</h2><p>Thankfully, not all of the links go to paid internet services. For your workflow, VEGAS Pro offers a number of great new additions. “Adjustment Tracks” is one of these. You can apply filters to entire tracks rather of needing to add them to individual segments.</p><p>By doing so, you may apply the same effects to numerous clips and manage their settings from a single area. Even better, you can keyframe these effects directly from the timeline to change their intensity over time. It’s simply some incredible visual effects software that wasn’t even imaginable previously in VEGAS.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975802/19272" target="_top" id="1975802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975802/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Scene-detection"><a href="#Scene-detection" class="headerlink" title="Scene detection"></a>Scene detection</h2><p>With version 19, VEGAS added a brand-new feature. They believe it to be so crucial that they have offered three options for doing it: split it whenever a cut occurs, examine finished, exported projects that you’ve brought back to the editing suite. Since we’ve been editing short films for almost 20 years, we haven’t needed to do it very often, but since we’re hoarders, most of our work are still accessible and editable. We become aware of how outnumbered we are as a result of this new characteristic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972670/19272" target="_top" id="1972670">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972670" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972670/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Upscale-options"><a href="#Upscale-options" class="headerlink" title="Upscale options"></a>Upscale options</h2><p>Upscaling is a fascinating advancement as well. The prior filter was getting on in years, but VEGAS has since unveiled a new AI-based one that performs far better. It claims to be able to transcode SD film (720x480) all the way up to 4K. (3840 x 2160). The filter has a straightforward slider; the higher you move it, the closer and more in-depth the clip will be with AI.</p><p>Naturally, the effects will be better the crisper and cleaner the source clip is. To be sure, the gadget is a surprising advancement, but one that is welcome. particularly when compared to earlier iterations of the video editing program.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151866/7443" target="_top" id="2151866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="VEGAS-Hub"><a href="#VEGAS-Hub" class="headerlink" title="VEGAS Hub"></a>VEGAS Hub</h2><p>The addition of the VEGAS Hub is one of the most noticeable visual changes. In both the form of a large login button at the top of the interface and a tab directly over the timeline.</p><p>VEGAS’ online presence is expanding, but the majority of the fun new features will only be available to subscribers. These days, it seems impossible to escape subscriptions; popular editors like Adobe Premiere Pro and Cyberlink PowerDirector both contain them. However, similar to PowerDirector, you have the option of subscribing or buying the software altogether.</p><p>One of these benefits is the capability to sync media between devices and save it online. It implies that moviemakers can use their smartphones to capture video, edit it, and then post it to the Hub. By the time you return to your editing station, those clips will be prepared.</p><p>Text to Speech, another intriguing subscription-only feature, speaks any sentences you provide it with using computer-generated voices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144288/7443" target="_top" id="2144288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144288/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-points"><a href="#Price-points" class="headerlink" title="Price points"></a>Price points</h2><p>With the new “Automatic Scene Detection,” you no longer need to manually clip your file if you need to re-edit or use a project but no longer have access to the original material, only the finished product. Selecting the file from the Project Media folder and selecting “Detect Scenes and Add to Timeline” are two options for doing this. VEGAS examines it, makes edits, and inserts each segment in turn to the timeline where the playhead is situated.</p><p>The same thing may be accomplished by choosing the alternative option of “Detect Scenes and Create Subclips,” except that it won’t add anything to the timeline and will instead add subclips of each cut to your Project Media folder. The last item is “Scene Detection” under Video FX. You have certain customization choices with this filter that are not available with the other two approaches. You have access to three sliders that allow you to alter the cuts’ sensitivity.</p><p>Who else is transitioning to a subscription model? VEGAS is. But those who favor paying for a perpetual license haven’t yet been forgotten. VEGAS Edit costs $250, Pro costs $400, and Post costs $600. In actuality, this is less expensive than the prior iteration.

The HoloLens came in an eye catching black box. The HoloLens comes in an interesting case with a zipper and once you unzip it, you come across a beautifully crafted head gear comprising of two rings with a lens.</p><p> Apart from the HoloLens, the box contains few accessories namely a get started guide, a charger with USB cable, a nose piece and a form fitting strap. Besides, there is also the new HoloLens Clicker, an optional accessory that comes with a finger loop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027176/19272" target="_top" id="2027176">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027176" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027176/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Main-features-of-Microsoft-HoloLens"><a href="#Main-features-of-Microsoft-HoloLens" class="headerlink" title="Main features of Microsoft HoloLens"></a>Main features of Microsoft HoloLens</h2><p> HoloLens consists of two rings- an outer thicker plastic ring that contains the guts and an inner, thinner ring that wraps around your head. This device isn’t essentially designed to sit on the user’s nose but there is a rubber nose guard that is optional to use. The headgear weighs approximately 579gms which means this one is definitely not a lighter device.</p><p> The headset contains holographic lenses and a depth camera along with speakers above the ears. There is literally a host of sensors built into the headset that include an ambient light sensor along with not just one or two but four environment sensing cameras that work in complete sync with depth sensing camera.</p><p> There is an onboard processing via Intel 32 bit architecture, a GPU, HPU that are backed by 2GB RAM and a humongous 64 GB onboard storage. The resolution of device is unbelievable in terms of picture and video quality and even the audio of HoloLens is admirable and the one that is bound to give every gamer a sensational gaming experience.</p><p> The release date for Microsoft’s HoloLens hasn’t been announced as yet but this device is available for developers and the people having a Microsoft account. The developer’s device is priced at $3000 but we are contemplating that it will be priced slightly on the lower side for the usual customers. A Microsoft account holder can order as many as 5 HoloLens from one account and if market trends are to be believed, the customer edition will be released around Christmas this year itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="User-experience"><a href="#User-experience" class="headerlink" title="User experience"></a>User experience</h2><p> Using Microsoft HoloLens was surely an experience of a lifetime, the one that you can’t easily forget. This wonderful device is filled with a number of pros, however we did come across a few cons as well, all of which are enlisted below for your quick reference.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Hands free hologram experience</li></ul><p> Using HoloLens is no rocket science, Microsoft has taken a number of steps to make this device extremely user friendly. There are no wires and remote control that works over this device, all you get is a head gear that has a few inbuilt buttons on the outer rin</p><ul><li>Impressive resolution</li></ul><p> Microsoft’s promise to give its users an ultimate holographic experience with HoloLens doesn’t seem illogical. The resolution of this device is so impressive that it literally transforms you to another world of digital excellence.</p><ul><li>Spatial sound like never before</li></ul><p> Apart from the high quality holographic resolution, HoloLens even boasts upon excellent spatial sound system that works wonders in giving its users a worthy AR experience.</p><ul><li>Excellent build quality</li></ul><p> Microsoft’s HoloLens comes with a headgear that might appear like few of its contemporaries, however the build quality that it comes with makes it all the more likeable and better device. HoloLens comes with a comfortable weight and sits right on the head giving its user a viewing experience like never before.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Average battery backup</li></ul><p> A $3000 augmented reality device like Microsoft’s HoloLens is expected to have a great battery backup but unfortunately, HoloLens disappoints on this front.</p><ul><li>Field of view certainly needs improvement</li></ul><p> A HoloLens user would certainly experience great viewing experience when he stands still but it somehow gets distorted once you start moving. Its field of view certainly needs a lot improvement.</p><ul><li>Still a glitch</li></ul><p> No matter how enthusiastically the Microsoft’s sales team is prompting HoloLens as realistic and user friendly, it is still a glitch for a regular gamer who isn’t really aware of the complexities and technicalities of using this device.</p><ul><li>Exorbitant price</li></ul><p> Let’s just be honest here, HoloLens is a one of a kind device that is bound to burn a hole in your pocket. $3000 for a technologically blessed gaming device, you need to make a smart choice here.</p><p> Keeping aside a few cons, Microsoft’s HoloLens is definitely one AR device that boasts upon high end technology and promises to give a wonderful gaming experience to its users. This one’s definitely a device that gives true worth of its hefty price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975807/19272" target="_top" id="1975807">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975807" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975807/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-hide-your-identity-share-your-life-instagram-live-secrets/"><u>[New] Hide Your Identity, Share Your Life -

You might have been looking in envy at those dreamy and hazy photos asking yourself: How did the photographer manage this? The answer is Picsart.</p><p>● This application has made blurring faces and backgrounds in photos a breeze. That means you can now easily reproduce the blur effect on your photography. The best part is: It is quick and simple to achieve this. Whether you want to hide distracting elements or highlight a figure in the foreground, Picsart can help.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-chuckle-chipmunks-robotic-jokesters/"><u>[New] In 2024, Chuckle Chipmunks Robotic Jokesters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-downloading-the-latest-tiktok-features-on-your-macbook/"><u>[New] In 2024, Downloading the Latest TikTok Features on Your MacBook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-zero-to-trendsetter-solo-podcast-success-story/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Zero to Trendsetter Solo Podcast Success Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-whatsapp-snapshots-now-with-beats-for-2024/"><u>[New] WhatsApp Snapshots, Now With Beats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ultimate-audio-alerts-high-quality-pages/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Ultimate Audio Alerts High-Quality Pages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-professional-techniques-for-mobile-and-dslr-igtv-mastery-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Professional Techniques for Mobile & DSLR IGTV Mastery for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/avoiding-common-pitfalls-in-rl-gameplay-recordings/"><u>Avoiding Common Pitfalls in RL Gameplay Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/enhancing-video-creativity-with-effective-filmora-strategies/"><u>Enhancing Video Creativity with Effective Filmora Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/essential-know-how-for-video-filter-integration-on-digital-platforms/"><u>Essential Know-How for Video Filter Integration on Digital Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-elite-rankings-top-10-apps-to-watch-football-and-volleyball-in-the-moment/"><u>In 2024, Elite Rankings Top 10 Apps to Watch Football & Volleyball in the Moment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-check-if-your-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-is-unlocked-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Check if Your Samsung Galaxy S24+ Is Unlocked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-probing-financial-depths-an-analysis-of-mr-beasts-wealth/"><u>In 2024, Probing Financial Depths An Analysis of Mr. Beast's Wealth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ath-to-earning-through-youtube-a-creators-guide/"><u>The Path to Earning Through YouTube A Creator's Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
