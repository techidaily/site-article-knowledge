What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Shooting Script"></a>3. Shooting Script</h3><p>The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Ensure the authenticity of the story"></a>1. Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene" class="headerlink" title="3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene"></a>3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene</h3><p>Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4. Visual Writing</h3><p>Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character’s situation. It is the most necessary thing in a documentary script, so you should never take it side.</p><h3 id="5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm"><a href="#5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm" class="headerlink" title="5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)"></a>5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</h3><p>Another important thing you should take care of while writing a documentary script is that you should continue it in a rhythm, which means you have to pay good attention to the sequence of the events in your film. In other words, you should arrange your script’s scenes effectively and accurately, making them in a rhythm.</p><h3 id="6-Fully-researched"><a href="#6-Fully-researched" class="headerlink" title="6. Fully researched"></a>6. Fully researched</h3><p>Thoroughly researched data and information are the most necessary, especially when writing a script for a documentary screenplay. It would be best first to explore a particular topic on which you will write a documentary script and then start writing one. It makes your script the best and helps you write it because you will gain excellent knowledge of it by researching a particular topic. Also, it dramatically improves the quality of your script’s content. So you should never leave this step before writing a documentary script.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Documentary-script-examples"><a href="#Part-4-Documentary-script-examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Documentary script examples"></a>Part 4. Documentary script examples</h2><p>As you can see in the following example of a documentary script of a screenplay named “Albert Einstein.” In the following script example, you can see that we have described the images on the left and the narrations on the right side of the table. Also, the primary sources have been highlighted in it and are in bold text, which will help others to recognize them.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>IMAGES</strong></th><th><strong>NARRATION</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Portrait of Albert Einstein</td><td>Once Albert Einstein said, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein Theories</td><td>Have you guys ever wondered why Albert Einstein is the most genius person in history?</td></tr><tr><td>Picture of Albert Einstein’s Brain and then Common Human Brain</td><td>Why is he the only human to use his brain the most?</td></tr><tr><td>Some video shorts of Albert Einstein’s interviews</td><td>Why does he often forget his name even though he is too intelligent?</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein</td><td>The answer to this question is in his quote, “The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.”</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein Theories</td><td>Also, do you guys know what Albert Einstein said about his intelligence?</td></tr><tr><td>Some video shorts of Albert Einstein’s interviews</td><td>He once said, “I have no special talent.”</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein and then his brain</td><td>However, he declined that he is brilliant.</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein Theories</td><td>But still, he is the one due to his various authentic and scientifically proven theories and experiments.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-5-Make-your-documentary-script-come-true-by-using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-5-Make-your-documentary-script-come-true-by-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

FPV System"></a>1. FPV System</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fpv-system.jpg"                                     ></p><p> FPV is abbreviation for First Person View. It is possible to connect your drone camera to remote device via Wi-Fi connection and then you can monitor all activities on LCD panel attached to that remote. One can also connect camera output directly to smart phone and then content can be streamed on real time basis. This feature is really useful for aerial photographers and videographers because it helps them to view all the shots properly and pre adjustments can be applied with ease. If you are thinking to enhance your experience further then one can buy <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >FPV Goggles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="2-Camera"><a href="#2-Camera" class="headerlink" title="2.Camera"></a>2.Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameras-for-uav.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Drone is an entertaining unit but it can also work like a real time spy when a camera is attached on its top. It will help you to record every detail on the way and users can view everything on their smart phones using FPV technology. Most of the drones offer cameras with 1080p resolution capabilities whereas few advanced ones can be adjusted to 4K resolution levels and details can also be reduced to 720p for few applications. Note that, when a camera is mounted on drone then it increases overall weight of the system so it will naturally reduce the overall flight time.</p><h4 id="3-3-Axis-Gimbal"><a href="#3-3-Axis-Gimbal" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Axis Gimbal"></a>3.3 Axis Gimbal</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-axis-gimbal.jpg"                                     ></p><p> There is no doubt to say that <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Gimbals <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are a smart addition to the world of drones that occupy camera units on the top. These gimbals help to stabilize camera footage even during harsh weather conditions. Once you get your gimbals installed with drone camera then you can expect shake free, vibration free and stable video from camera. Drones commonly have two types of gimbal adjustments: it can be either two axis type of it can be 3-axis type. Both have different impact on shooting where 3-axis is naturally a better choice for higher level of stabilization and it is useful for professional videographers.</p><h4 id="4-Battery"><a href="#4-Battery" class="headerlink" title="4.Battery"></a>4.Battery</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/batteries-for-drone.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> help drones to gain power for their actions. The overall flight time of a drone actually depends upon its battery thus it is considered as one of the most essential accessory for drone enthusiast. Generally, drone packages come with additional batteries when you have ordered a unit with removable batteries otherwise you need to take a break every time to get this battery charged. A drone pilot is always happy to see his drone battery full as it leads to biggest pleasure in air but one must have proper arrangements for discharged batteries.</p><h4 id="5-Landing-Pad"><a href="#5-Landing-Pad" class="headerlink" title="5.Landing Pad"></a>5.Landing Pad</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/landing-pand-for-drones.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Many professional drone users love to install additional landing pads to their drones as it helps to make landing movement much smoother. It is like an additional physical space between ground and drone that keeps it safe from damage while landing fast on ground from huge height. These landing gears use to absorb shock at the time of landing and naturally minimized the chances of drone damage. But the disadvantage is that it adds up some weight to this structure and causes some reduction in overall flight time. Prefer to pick a landing gear that is made up of carbon fiber material as it uses to have more strength to weight ratio.</p><h4 id="6-Transmitter-Controller"><a href="#6-Transmitter-Controller" class="headerlink" title="6.Transmitter&#x2F;Controller"></a>6.Transmitter&#x2F;Controller</h4><p> If you want to use your drone for professional aerial videography or photography then it is essential to have specially designed controllers or transmitters. When you have to switch from auto pilot mode to manual mode then this controller will help you to organise flight in much better manner. These transmitters provide additional control over flights when you drone is in the air. Most of the drones include these controllers in basic package whereas for others you need to buy additional from stores.</p><h4 id="7-Propeller-Guards"><a href="#7-Propeller-Guards" class="headerlink" title="7.Propeller Guards"></a>7.Propeller Guards</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/propeller-guards.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Here is one more essential accessory for your drone; these propeller guards are more useful to those users who organize drone fights in air with friends. These guards help to protect propellers installed on a drone unit at the time of crashes or collisions. They are essential for ensuring long life of a drone unit.</p><h4 id="8-Extra-Propellers"><a href="#8-Extra-Propellers" class="headerlink" title="8.Extra Propellers"></a>8.Extra Propellers</h4><p> As we already considered the important of propellers for drone units as they use to protect propellers but in case if somehow your propellers suffer a damage then you may need to replace them with new one. It is good to think smart and always stay ready with additional pair of propellers for your device. They are very affordable accessories and can be easily ordered online. The best part is that you can easily replace your propellers with do it yourself procedures and your drone will soon be ready to take a flight in air.</p><h4 id="9-Micro-Cards"><a href="#9-Micro-Cards" class="headerlink" title="9.Micro Cards"></a>9.Micro Cards</h4><p> Micro SD cards that are used for drones use to be same as that of other common memory cards that we all have in our smart phones. If you have a camera type drone then it is essential to have a memory card installed inside your unit where footage can be saved at the time of recording. All drones possess different memory card handling capabilities so you need to check their specifications before buying a new one. Prefer to pick one with class 10 rating to have impressive results and better compatibility. Generally the file size of 4K recorded footage will be much higher as compared to 720p recording so your memory card must be capable enough to handle that size.</p><h4 id="10-Carrying-Case"><a href="#10-Carrying-Case" class="headerlink" title="10.Carrying Case"></a>10.Carrying Case</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/carrying-case-for-drone.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Drones are not just a toy, this is a big investment for your passion thus one needs to make proper arrangements to keep it safe. One of the most important tasks that every drone lover use to do is buy a good quality case of protective housing for their drone where it can reside safely. We are not talking about a normal polybag or backpack rather you need to spend one a bag that is specially designed for drones and can keep all essential accessories safely inside.

It allows you to fully control the intensity and color saturation of the green screen. You are free to light your subject as you wish and avoid any shadows falling on the background. So typically two or more lights are used to light the green screen. Adjust the light positions and filters until you get the satisfying result. If your subject is human, it requires 6-10 feet between your subject and the background.</p><p>Don’t throw too much light onto the green background. That will create hotspots and “green spill” on the subject and make the key less effective. The key to lighting a green screen is consistency – create a single, consistent shade of color across the entire screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/green-screen-lighting-tips.png"                      alt="Lighting tips in shooting a Green Screen Video"                ></p><p>Check out our picks of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the best lighting equipment for shooting videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2Camera-tips-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video"><a href="#2Camera-tips-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="2Camera tips in shooting a Green Screen Video"></a>2Camera tips in shooting a Green Screen Video</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/green-screen-mistake-6.png"                      alt="Camera tips in shooting a Green Screen Video"                ></p><p>When lighting your key surface, make sure the bounce light is not directed at the camera (as shown in the image above). For example, if your camera faces the key surface directly, set your lights at 45 degree angles to the key surface. This will ensure that the bounce light bounces toward the other light and not at the camera.</p><p>Also choose carefully the camera as some cameras are better to shoot green screen video, especially if you are shooting something with a bit of movement. Then shoot your video as HD quality video (720p or higher) and save in a format your green screen software can import.</p><p>When shooting the green screen video, it’s of great importance to keep the camera very still and a tripod is necessary for this purpose. The simplest shot is to captures the whole body in the center of the cloth so that none of the peripheral edges of the room can been seen. Another general rule is that it’s better to lose legs in a shot than the head of an individual. Although sometimes it’s essential to film a perspective that break these rules, many problems can be overcome in the editing process.</p><p>Looking for some best cameras for shooting green screen video?

Perhaps one of the simplest mistakes that many people make with green screen video shooting is actually wearing green clothing. If you are wearing clothing or clothing that has buttons or accents that are a similar color green as your selected background green, the image that you project onto the green screen in post-editing will also get picked up by these accents on your clothing or by the clothing itself. This is great if you want to cut off part of an actor’s body, but not so professional if you are trying to make an actor appear in a realistic scene.</p><h4 id="4-Wrinkles-problem-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video"><a href="#4-Wrinkles-problem-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="4 Wrinkles problem in shooting a Green Screen Video"></a>4 Wrinkles problem in shooting a Green Screen Video</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/green-screen-mistake-2.png"                      alt="Wrinkles problem in shooting a Green Screen Video"                ></p><p>Wrinkles in your screen can actually lead to heavy shadows and distorted image quality in your green screen video. If you regularly fold your green screen for storage it’s very important that you take an iron out and flat negative green screen to prevent shadows and distortions with your background image. This is a step that many skip over but it’s important to have a high-quality green screen without wrinkles and folds that cause shadows.</p><h4 id="5-Motion-blur-problem-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video"><a href="#5-Motion-blur-problem-in-shooting-a-Green-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="5 Motion blur problem in shooting a Green Screen Video"></a>5 Motion blur problem in shooting a Green Screen Video</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/green-screen-mistake-4.png"                      alt="Motion blur problem in shooting a Green Screen Video"                ></p><p>If you are planning on shooting a high action scene in front of a green screen with a camera that only has lower shutter speeds, you can run into real problems. When using a camera with a lower shutter speed consider doing action shots in slow motion or getting subjects to not make any sudden movements in front of the green screen. Motion blur from someone moving rapidly on camera in front of a green screen can really ruin the scene and ruin the realism of the scene. Alternately you could also consider renting a high shutter speed camera to avoid this motion blur if you do plan on shooting a lot of action scenes. Ultimately this is something that you will need to test for yourself before shooting a green screen video, so that you can get a feel for how much action your camera can handle with a green screen without motion blur.</p><p>Wanna adding a fake camera shake effect to your video?

Right? Not anymore, as we have already figured this out for you. Ahead, you will learn what podcast script is. How to write one? Also, we have listed some pro tips and added some ready-to-go templates to help you get started. So, stay connected till last.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-a-Podcast-Script-and-Why-Do-We-Need-One"><a href="#What-Is-a-Podcast-Script-and-Why-Do-We-Need-One" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Podcast Script, and Why Do We Need One?"></a>What Is a Podcast Script, and Why Do We Need One?</h2><p>A podcast script is simply a plan for the podcast that outlines the main topics in a sequence. Based on your feasibility and the type of show, it can be detailed or include the essential things. However, the majority of podcast scripts adhere to the following basic format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-write-podcast-script-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast script"                ></p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p>The intro is supposed to build the audience’s interest as soon as they start listening to the podcast. So here, you will warmly welcome your listeners, say some icebreaker sentences, give your intro, and state teaser lines about the podcast.</p><p>*Pro tip: Don’t reveal everything; keep it a little mysterious to hook listeners till the end.</p><h3 id="Guest-intro"><a href="#Guest-intro" class="headerlink" title="Guest intro"></a>Guest intro</h3><p>The guest introduction is crucial because people listen attentively if an expert addresses the topic. So, courteously welcome your guest, and mention his name, profession, achievements, and background (if related to the topic).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880960/19272" target="_top" id="1880960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Sponsor-message"><a href="#Sponsor-message" class="headerlink" title="Sponsor message"></a>Sponsor message</h3><p>Every brand has a distinct set of preferences; sometimes, they give you a script that you have to follow word for word, and other times they leave it up to you. In either case, the sponsor messaging should look natural and blend with the layout of your show. Besides, a persuasive sponsor message script will motivate listeners to buy brand products, thereby boosting your number of sponsors—a win-win situation.</p><h3 id="Segue"><a href="#Segue" class="headerlink" title="Segue"></a>Segue</h3><p>When there are multiple segments in an episode, transitions make switching from one to the next seamless. For example, it may be a piece of music, a phrase, motion graphics, etc.</p><h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>It’s challenging to retain everything after listening to a significant amount of information. Hence, to facilitate listeners, summarize the entire episode and revise the key takeaways.</p><h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p>It’s time to acknowledge the listeners and guests for their precious time. To tie listeners to your show, you can mention references, make announcements, and reveal the topic and air time of the upcoming episode.</p><h3 id="Call-to-action"><a href="#Call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="Call to action"></a>Call to action</h3><p>A straightforward call to action can boost the reach of the podcast. Here is how?</p><p>Invite the audience to leave a review, share their thoughts about the topic in the comment section, and show your availability to interact with them and answer their queries.</p><h3 id="Why-do-you-need-one"><a href="#Why-do-you-need-one" class="headerlink" title="Why do you need one?"></a>Why do you need one?</h3><p>Having said that, let me tell you why writing a podcast script is crucial before you hit the record button. First, having a podcast script will simplify things for you and your guest, as you’ll know the next point already; otherwise, you will make a mess.</p><p>Averting unnecessary gaps and saving time requires planning the segment order and making a list of the main points to discuss. The script ensures you stay on topic and organized to keep listeners interested. A well-planned podcast also requires less effort in post-production. So if you want a streamlined recording experience, take your time and craft a top-notch podcast script.</p><h2 id="Podcast-Script-Outline-Templates"><a href="#Podcast-Script-Outline-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Podcast Script Outline Templates"></a>Podcast Script Outline Templates</h2><p>As promised, it’s time to introduce you to the three most common podcast script templates. Pick the one that best suits your needs and take your podcast to the next level.</p><h3 id="Template-1-The-Word-For-Word-Podcast-Script"><a href="#Template-1-The-Word-For-Word-Podcast-Script" class="headerlink" title="Template 1: The Word-For-Word Podcast Script"></a>Template 1: The Word-For-Word Podcast Script</h3><p>The first right candidate for the word-for-word script is the one about to land in the podcast world. All that is left to do is carry them out correctly since most things have already been written down. This format should also be used by someone presenting a lot of statistical data, facts, and figures.</p><p><strong>Structure</strong></p><ul><li>Intro: Introduce yourself, the topic of discussion, and the guests if there; episode teaser (Span: ___ )</li><li>[Sponsor message]</li><li>[Theme music]</li><li>Topic 1: _____(Span: __ )</li><li>Principal point</li><li>Supporting points</li><li>Quotations, data, or other facts</li><li>Segue (can be a phrase, a piece of music, or a sound effect)</li><li>Topic 2: _______(Span: __ )</li><li>Principal point</li><li>Supporting points</li><li>Quotations, data, or other facts</li><li>[Sponsor message]</li><li>Topic 3: _______(Span: __ )</li><li>Principal point</li><li>Supporting points</li><li>Quotations, data, or other facts</li><li>Outro: _____ (Span: __ )</li><li>Overview</li><li>Call to action</li><li>[Closing theme music]</li></ul><p><strong>Template</strong></p><p>[Intro music]</p><p>Intro:</p><p>Hello and welcome to (show name); I’m (hostname).

There is a high likelihood that people will ignore you if you ask them to “Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts” or something similar.</p><p>Make sure to properly guide and simplify the task for the listeners if you want them to fulfill it. The links to other platforms where your podcast is available can be either attached in the notes section or included in the podcast itself.</p><p><strong>(2) Don’t overdo it with CTAs – it’s good to have a range, but stick to one or two per episode.</strong></p><p>Sometimes podcasters get overenthusiastic and stuff each episode with CTAs. That’s insane… Right? Respecting your audience’s time is just as crucial as getting views; failing to do so will result in losing them.</p><p>It’s good to have a range of CTAs, but stick to one or two per episode and try the rest in future episodes. It’s okay to repeat that one or two CTAs a couple of times during the episode to increase the probability that viewers will follow through.</p><p><strong>(3) Mention that it’s free to follow or subscribe</strong></p><p>Along with the CTA message, it’s a good idea to mention that following or subscribing is free. However, people may think they need to pay to subscribe because everything is shifting to a charged model from a free one.</p><p><strong>(4) Know the animating question of your podcast episode, and focus on answering it</strong></p><p>One of the most effective ways to keep the listeners interested throughout the episode is to communicate answers to their questions about that topic. The animating question is that a specific part of your episode answers an existing question. The key to finding the animating questions is “Research,” which will help you focus on the answers listeners want to hear.</p><h2 id="Podcast-script-Hot-FAQs"><a href="#Podcast-script-Hot-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Podcast script Hot FAQs"></a>Podcast script Hot FAQs</h2><p>Sometimes the curiosity of people frightens me.

With this technique, you can capture the dark and light tones in the scenery.</p><p>The science behind it is that the camera captures a scene twice or thrice with different exposures. Then, it combines all the exposures and creates an image that focuses on the dark and the light tones.</p><p>There are different scenarios where HDR photography can be helpful. Especially in spaces where you have to capture the whole landscape or the true colors of the sky.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/sns-hdr-pro-review-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr photography captures images"                ></p><p>HDR technique is also useful when your camera is not up to mark and does not capture what your eye sees. In this case, you can use a software such as SNS HDR to use HDR editing to make the image as close to reality as possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/sns-hdr-pro-review-2.jpg"                      alt="use hdr editing to edit images"                ></p><h2 id="Review-in-Detail-on-SNS-HDR"><a href="#Review-in-Detail-on-SNS-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Review in Detail on SNS HDR"></a>Review in Detail on SNS HDR</h2><p>Now that you have an idea of how useful the HDR technique can be for you let’s take a detailed look at SNS HDR and its features.</p><p>SNS HDR is a software for processing HDR images to create realistic shots. It uses the HDR technique to create images from a batch of photos as well as process single images. It has a wide variety of tools that help in getting natural-looking photos.</p><p>An interesting fact about SNS HDR is that it is available in three versions: SNS HDR Pro, SNS HDR Home, and SNS HDR Lite. Each of them has different licenses and provides a different set of features.</p><p>Here we are going to look at SNS HDR Pro and what features it offers.</p><h3 id="SNS-HDR-Pro’s-Features"><a href="#SNS-HDR-Pro’s-Features" class="headerlink" title="SNS HDR Pro’s Features"></a>SNS HDR Pro’s Features</h3><p><strong><em>1.</em> <em>Graphical User Interface</em></strong></p><p>SNS HDR Pro has a graphical user interface that makes it really easy for users to get equipped with HDR editing. It has sliders on the right side of the screen that help you adjust different settings. It is pretty user-friendly and does not take much time to get accustomed to.</p><p>Such a user interface is beneficial for new users as they don’t have to put in a lot of effort to get used to it.</p><p><strong><em>2.</em> <em>Batch Processing Module</em></strong></p><p>The next feature of SNS HDR Pro is batch processing. Like most HDR software, SNS HDR Pro also offers batch processing. With the help of this feature, you can add images of multiple exposures so that the software can process them into a single HDR image.</p><p>This is helpful when you take batch photos with your camera. These photos should preferably have different exposures so that you can use SNS HDR’s batch processing feature to combine all the different exposures to get a single picture with all the right tones.</p><p><strong><em>3.</em> <em>Built-in and User Presets</em></strong></p><p>Another cool feature that SNS HDR Pro has is that it provides its users with built-in presets. You can use these presets by clicking on them. They are present on the left side of the screen. As the name suggests, these presets are an already constructed set of settings. When you click on them, those specific settings are applied to the image.</p><p>This is helpful as you do not have to go through the tedious task of adjusting each aspect of the image yourself. If you want to finish your editing quickly, presets are your best option.</p><p>Moreover, you can also create your own presets and save them for future use.</p><p><strong><em>4.</em> <em>Masks</em></strong></p><p>Masking is another feature that SNS HDR Pro offers. Using this feature, you can edit specific parts of your image. Usually, when you add an effect, the whole picture changes according to it.</p><p>With masks, you can highlight an area of the image and edit that area solely without affecting the rest of the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087390/7443" target="_top" id="2087390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="User-Reviews"><a href="#User-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="User Reviews"></a>User Reviews</h3><p>Many users worldwide have used SNS HDR Pro and given certain feedback.

A user Darle T. gave a review stating that</p><p><em>“I like that I can use use my HDR app to fix the extreme dynamic range of my TIFFS to create a fairly dull, dynamically flat, but still realistic image.”</em></p><p>Another user mentions</p><p><em>“Very clean blends, natural results, good workflow, batch processing with option for manual input. Great thought-out package.”</em></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-to-Edit-and-Deliver-your-HDR-Videos-to-YouTube-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-to-Edit-and-Deliver-your-HDR-Videos-to-YouTube-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How to Edit and Deliver your HDR Videos to YouTube with Wondershare Filmora?"></a>Pro Tip: How to Edit and Deliver your HDR Videos to YouTube with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</h2><p>Although SNS HDR offers excellent features and it also has good reviews, another such tool for HDR videos is Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

With this technique, you can capture the dark and light tones in the scenery.</p><p>The science behind it is that the camera captures a scene twice or thrice with different exposures. Then, it combines all the exposures and creates an image that focuses on the dark and the light tones.</p><p>There are different scenarios where HDR photography can be helpful. Especially in spaces where you have to capture the whole landscape or the true colors of the sky.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/sns-hdr-pro-review-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr photography captures images"                ></p><p>HDR technique is also useful when your camera is not up to mark and does not capture what your eye sees. In this case, you can use a software such as SNS HDR to use HDR editing to make the image as close to reality as possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/sns-hdr-pro-review-2.jpg"                      alt="use hdr editing to edit images"                ></p><h2 id="Review-in-Detail-on-SNS-HDR-1"><a href="#Review-in-Detail-on-SNS-HDR-1" class="headerlink" title="Review in Detail on SNS HDR"></a>Review in Detail on SNS HDR</h2><p>Now that you have an idea of how useful the HDR technique can be for you let’s take a detailed look at SNS HDR and its features.</p><p>SNS HDR is a software for processing HDR images to create realistic shots. It uses the HDR technique to create images from a batch of photos as well as process single images. It has a wide variety of tools that help in getting natural-looking photos.</p><p>An interesting fact about SNS HDR is that it is available in three versions: SNS HDR Pro, SNS HDR Home, and SNS HDR Lite. Each of them has different licenses and provides a different set of features.</p><p>Here we are going to look at SNS HDR Pro and what features it offers.</p><h3 id="SNS-HDR-Pro’s-Features-1"><a href="#SNS-HDR-Pro’s-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="SNS HDR Pro’s Features"></a>SNS HDR Pro’s Features</h3><p><strong><em>1.</em> <em>Graphical User Interface</em></strong></p><p>SNS HDR Pro has a graphical user interface that makes it really easy for users to get equipped with HDR editing. It has sliders on the right side of the screen that help you adjust different settings. It is pretty user-friendly and does not take much time to get accustomed to.</p><p>Such a user interface is beneficial for new users as they don’t have to put in a lot of effort to get used to it.</p><p><strong><em>2.</em> <em>Batch Processing Module</em></strong></p><p>The next feature of SNS HDR Pro is batch processing. Like most HDR software, SNS HDR Pro also offers batch processing. With the help of this feature, you can add images of multiple exposures so that the software can process them into a single HDR image.</p><p>This is helpful when you take batch photos with your camera. These photos should preferably have different exposures so that you can use SNS HDR’s batch processing feature to combine all the different exposures to get a single picture with all the right tones.</p><p><strong><em>3.</em> <em>Built-in and User Presets</em></strong></p><p>Another cool feature that SNS HDR Pro has is that it provides its users with built-in presets. You can use these presets by clicking on them. They are present on the left side of the screen. As the name suggests, these presets are an already constructed set of settings. When you click on them, those specific settings are applied to the image.</p><p>This is helpful as you do not have to go through the tedious task of adjusting each aspect of the image yourself. If you want to finish your editing quickly, presets are your best option.</p><p>Moreover, you can also create your own presets and save them for future use.</p><p><strong><em>4.</em> <em>Masks</em></strong></p><p>Masking is another feature that SNS HDR Pro offers. Using this feature, you can edit specific parts of your image. Usually, when you add an effect, the whole picture changes according to it.</p><p>With masks, you can highlight an area of the image and edit that area solely without affecting the rest of the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049363/7443" target="_top" id="2049363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049363/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="User-Reviews-1"><a href="#User-Reviews-1" class="headerlink" title="User Reviews"></a>User Reviews</h3><p>Many users worldwide have used SNS HDR Pro and given certain feedback. Among these, we have some really great photographers such Nick Powell from 360 Photography who says that</p><p><em>“I have been using SNS HDR for over 2 years now and I can safely say that it is the best HDR software (in my opinion) that there is on the market today.”</em></p><p>Other users have also commented on different platforms. A user Darle T. gave a review stating that</p><p><em>“I like that I can use use my HDR app to fix the extreme dynamic range of my TIFFS to create a fairly dull, dynamically flat, but still realistic image.”</em></p><p>Another user mentions</p><p><em>“Very clean blends, natural results, good workflow, batch processing with option for manual input. Great thought-out package.”</em></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-to-Edit-and-Deliver-your-HDR-Videos-to-YouTube-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-to-Edit-and-Deliver-your-HDR-Videos-to-YouTube-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How to Edit and Deliver your HDR Videos to YouTube with Wondershare Filmora?"></a>Pro Tip: How to Edit and Deliver your HDR Videos to YouTube with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</h2><p>Although SNS HDR offers excellent features and it also has good reviews, another such tool for HDR videos is Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

AndroVid doesn’t have any premium plugins either, but it does include an online asset shop for music, fonts, and other items that you can access more of by upgrading to Pro.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Key-features-of-AndroVid-Video-Editor-Maker-1"><a href="#Part-2-Key-features-of-AndroVid-Video-Editor-Maker-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

But you didn’t have time to go through it, and you bookmarked it. Now, you came back to read it and, oh no…… It has been deleted for some reason.</p><p>No need to worry. You can see deleted Reddit posts in seconds. In fact, there are several simple methods to do this.</p><p>We’ll cover the best ones below and explain how to use each one.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Unddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Reveddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Resavr</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">The Wayback Machine</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Google Cache</a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts"><a href="#5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts"></a>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</h2><h3 id="1-Unddit"><a href="#1-Unddit" class="headerlink" title="1. Unddit"></a>1. Unddit</h3><p>Unddit is a third-party tool that uses Pushshift.io. This is a database that stores comments users leave on Reddit.</p><p>The main reason Unddit is so popular and used is because of its simplicity. It is easy to use the tool and takes about 10 seconds to set it all up. Let’s go over the steps to use Unddit and reveal some deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>Step1 First, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.unddit.com/" >Unddit.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step2 Click on the red “Unddit” button and drag it to your bookmark bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/red-unddit-button.png"                      alt="unddit button pointing to bookmark"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144273/7443" target="_top" id="2144273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144273/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Go to the deleted Reddit post</p><p>Step4 Click on the Unddit bookmark you just saved</p><p>This will automatically lead you to a new page. There, Unddit analyses and displays all the deleted comments from that post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/unddit-results.png"                      alt="results page on unddit tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006933/19272" target="_top" id="2006933">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006933" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006933/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>On the downside, Reddit doesn’t work well with most Reddit posts. It’s more effective for revealing deleted comments. Additionally, it may show an error from time to time. Unfortunately, the reason isn’t always displayed, and it’s something we need to live with.</p><h3 id="2-Reveddit"><a href="#2-Reveddit" class="headerlink" title="2. Reveddit"></a>2. Reveddit</h3><p>Unlike Unddit, Reveddit will always help you find deleted Reddit posts. It’s a powerful tool and much more stable compared to so many others out there.</p><p>This tool tracks Reddit activity in real-time. For example, you can use it to track deleted posts from specific users and subreddits. You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr"><a href="#3-Resavr" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880931/19272" target="_top" id="1880931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature. There’s no way to search for a specific Reddit post. Instead, you can only view recent posts with deleted comments. Or you can type in a specific word and go through all the posts that pop up to find what you’re looking for.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1838960/17916" target="_top" id="1838960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1838960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1838960/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Wayback-Machine"><a href="#4-The-Wayback-Machine" class="headerlink" title="4. The Wayback Machine"></a>4. The Wayback Machine</h3><p>The Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that stores archives of other websites’ caches. It’s a non-profit site that lets you see deleted Reddit posts and comments that have been stored in the past.</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated to use, but it offers fantastic results. So, here’s what you need to do:</p><p>Step1 Visit archive.org.

But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><h3 id="5-Google-Cache"><a href="#5-Google-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky.

Unddit"></a>1. Unddit</h3><p>Unddit is a third-party tool that uses Pushshift.io. This is a database that stores comments users leave on Reddit.</p><p>The main reason Unddit is so popular and used is because of its simplicity. It is easy to use the tool and takes about 10 seconds to set it all up. Let’s go over the steps to use Unddit and reveal some deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>Step1 First, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.unddit.com/" >Unddit.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step2 Click on the red “Unddit” button and drag it to your bookmark bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/red-unddit-button.png"                      alt="unddit button pointing to bookmark"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Go to the deleted Reddit post</p><p>Step4 Click on the Unddit bookmark you just saved</p><p>This will automatically lead you to a new page. There, Unddit analyses and displays all the deleted comments from that post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/unddit-results.png"                      alt="results page on unddit tool"                ></p><p>On the downside, Reddit doesn’t work well with most Reddit posts. It’s more effective for revealing deleted comments. Additionally, it may show an error from time to time. Unfortunately, the reason isn’t always displayed, and it’s something we need to live with.</p><h3 id="2-Reveddit-1"><a href="#2-Reveddit-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Reveddit"></a>2. Reveddit</h3><p>Unlike Unddit, Reveddit will always help you find deleted Reddit posts. It’s a powerful tool and much more stable compared to so many others out there.</p><p>This tool tracks Reddit activity in real-time. For example, you can use it to track deleted posts from specific users and subreddits. You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr-1"><a href="#3-Resavr-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discovering-the-Benefits-of-Personalized-ASMR-Sounds"><a href="#Discovering-the-Benefits-of-Personalized-ASMR-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="Discovering the Benefits of Personalized ASMR Sounds"></a>Discovering the Benefits of Personalized ASMR Sounds</h2><p><strong>Why is ASMR relaxing</strong>? As the globe becomes connected, new trends and fads emerge regularly. One of these developments is Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), which has taken the world by storm in recent years. What began as a tiny community on sites such as YouTube has become a global sensation. Individuals of all ages (even celebrities!) are generating their own ASMR films on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and others.</p><p>But just what is ASMR? The experience differs from individual to individual, but the fundamental notion is the tingling feeling individuals get when exposed to specific noises such as whispering, tapping, and others. So <strong>why do people like ASMR</strong>? Read on to know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-1.png"                      alt="benefits of asmr"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR"><a href="#Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?"></a>Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?</h2><p>Some individuals experience ASMR in response to various sensory “triggers.” It may be listening to someone talk or tapping or seeing someone brush their hair or folding their clothing with care and precision. It could also be particular noises like tapping or whispering. In addition, one of the most common triggers in ordinary life is a light touch, such as caressing someone’s arm or tracing one’s fingers on the back.</p><p>Here are some fundamental reasons <strong>why people like ASMR</strong>:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-2.png"                      alt="why people like asmr"                ></p><ul><li><strong>ASMR helps one cope with Stress &amp; Anxiety:</strong> Studies fund that ASMR assists people in dealing with stress and anxiety. One <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2018/06/26/asmr-research-survey-affect-physiology/" >2018 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that ASMR reduced stress, while another in 2017 discovered that 11% of individuals viewed ASMR videos mainly to assist them in coping with anxiety. Similarly, 2015 research found that 70% of its participants utilized ASMR films to cope with stress. It’s not just anecdotal evidence—research reveals that individuals who watch ASMR regularly report feeling happier and less stressed than those who don’t!</li><li><strong>It helps some people solve sleeping issues:</strong> If this is the case, you are not alone. Many individuals use ASMR as a sleep aid by many individuals. According to a <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2017/11/09/asmr-research-survey-personality-empathy-triggers/" >2017 study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 41% of individuals utilized ASMR to help them fall asleep. Another <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that 82 percent of the subjects used ASMR to fall asleep because the videos are low-stress and calming. Because they generally center on relaxing sounds or sights, viewing ASMR videos might help you unwind after a busy day and prepare for the night.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?"></a>Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?</h2><p>Another pertinent query relating to the above section would be <strong>why ASMR is relaxing</strong>. Here is a detailed and factual answer.</p><p>ASMR is a sense of quiet, relaxation, and comfort from viewing particular videos that often show someone executing a delicate job, such as speaking or tapping on things. These films visibly improve people’s tranquillity and help them fall asleep quicker. They also establish a bond between the maker of the video and the viewer. You can trace this behavior back to ancient times when individuals would listen to others tell tales to feel comfortable and at peace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-3.jpg"                      alt="why is asmr relaxing"                ></p><p>Giulia Poerio’s Hubbub public engagement work has included her <a class="link"   href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28427/Bookshelf%5FNBK453230.pdf?sequence=1#page=123" >psychological research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). The research stated that relaxing, tingling sensations begin at the top of the head and spread down the neck, spine, and sometimes throughout the rest of the body in response to specific triggers. According to this study, ASMR is fascinating, whether experienced or not. The sheer number of YouTube videos and accompanying viewership data show that it is far from a niche experience. According to anecdotal evidence, you can use ASMR as a sleep aid and a technique for increasing wellness.</p><p>People have even employed ASMR to assist them in curing their discomfort. While it requires further research to support this assertion, they conducted a study to keep it. In <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015, an analysis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> indicated that 42 percent of individuals said ASMR helped them cope with chronic pain.</p><p>Scientists are still debating how ASMR can reduce chronic pain, although some relate it to the release of endorphins during an ASMR session. Endorphins are substances in the body that may make us happy and diminish our sense of pain. However, there is no authentication to support this idea.</p><p>Although they carried out a considerable study on ASMR and its impact on chronic pain, many individuals have found relief utilizing ASMR videos for their condition! If you suffer from chronic pain, try watching these ASMR videos for pleasure or to see if they help relieve your symptoms.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You"><a href="#Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?"></a>Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?</h2><p>The study of ASMR is in its infancy at the moment. However, both anecdotal evidence and preliminary studies suggest that autonomic sensory meridian response, or ASMR, will have some positive effects, including the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-4.jpg"                      alt="is asmr good"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Immediate Relief:</strong> When someone experiences the chills and tingles associated with ASMR, we describe it as a delightful and calming sensation that occurs relatively quickly after exposure to the stimulus.</li><li><strong>The elevated state of mind</strong>: Early research found that after exposure to ASMR, eighty percent of Trusted Source participants experienced an improvement in their mood. People with greater levels of depression had a quicker drop in their benefits.</li><li><strong>Pain alleviation:</strong> The same research According to Reliable Source, some individuals who suffer from chronic pain had relief that lasted for up to three hours after being exposed to the substance.</li><li><strong>Greater intensity of focus</strong>: When you’re so engrossed in something that you lose track of time and concentrate so intently on it, you’re said to be in a “flow state.” Researchers have discovered that ASMR and the sort of focused attention you get when you’re in the zone, also known as flow, have been commonalities.</li><li><strong>Better sleep:</strong> ASMR has been found in preliminary studies to have the potential to assist in inducing a state of relaxation. Also, improve brainwave activity, which is necessary for a good night’s rest.</li><li><strong>Other advantages:</strong> People who participate in ASMR activities note improvements in areas such as decreased anxiety, fewer migraines, lower blood pressure, and other health benefits. Although they are consistent with what they tell us, these assertions still need to be supported by more studies.</li></ul><p>The best part is that almost anybody can use it. If you think these advantages may benefit you, you can try them. You can find out <strong>if ASMR is good for you</strong> without spending money or a doctor’s prescription online.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQ-People-Also-Ask"><a href="#Part-4-FAQ-People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQ: People Also Ask"></a>Part 4: FAQ: People Also Ask</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135316/14409" target="_top" id="2135316">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135316" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135316/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Does-ASMR-kill-brain-cells"><a href="#1-Does-ASMR-kill-brain-cells" class="headerlink" title="1.

Solid design, simple usage and intuitive multi-touch gesture makes this app an all time winner. Especially when you are answering “ how to shorten a video on iPhone? Despite its editing capabilities, we will keep our focus on video resizing. It’s a video size reducer, that can import file directly from iPhone. There are many options to trim, rotate, duplicate, split or delete clip. By default a photo in a timeline will be a clip for 6 to 12 seconds of onscreen time. Trimming photo will mean cutting the on-screen duration.</p><ul><li>Open the project</li><li>Tap the video or photo in timeline to be shortened</li><li>Drag yellow trim handler to shorten the video or photo</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iMovie-shorten.jpeg"                      alt="imoive"                ></p><p> But, it can be, that you don’t want to delete parts at all. Instead you want to make “large” size a little bit more manageable. For that sake, another way to trim video, iPhone camera roll has ,is, by resizing. But resizing and compressions are tricky. You need to consider video dimension (pixels), aspect ratio and resolution. Above all resizing doesn’t mean sacrificing quality. One best way to do that is to use Desqueeze.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044583/7443" target="_top" id="2044583">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044583" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044583/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-resize-a-video-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-resize-a-video-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to resize a video on iPhone"></a>Part 2: How to resize a video on iPhone</h2><h4 id="1-Desqueeze"><a href="#1-Desqueeze" class="headerlink" title="1.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

In addition, gaming monitors are a completely new concept for many console owners. It was easy to choose a 4K TV with Xbox One, but we experienced some interesting alternatives when the next generation came along.</p><p>As console owners gravitate toward monitors in order to take advantage of the incredible framerates and resolutions the Xbox Series X can deliver, the pull of monitors appears to be increasing. Let’s check out some of our top picks for the best monitors for Xbox Series X, and keep in mind that HDMI 2.1 monitors are on the way, so if you’re interested in seeing what’s coming, please head over to our top picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                      alt="xbox-seriesx"                ></p><h4 id="Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="Using a monitor with Xbox Series X"></a><strong>Using a monitor with Xbox Series X</strong></h4><p>The best way to enjoy Xbox Series X is to get a monitor that supports either 8K at 60hz or 4K at 120hz, which means that you’ll need an HDMI 2.1 monitor. In spite of the fact that there are some amazing HDMI 2.1 cable options out there, HDMI 2.1 monitors are not as common as they could be at this moment, but we expect them to appear soon.</p><p>Accordingly, the most common monitor options available for Xbox Series X gamers as of right now are 1080p at 120Hz, 1440p at 120Hz, or 4K at 60Hz. Even though 120hz gaming doesn’t require an HDMI 2.1 monitor, one popular approach involves lowering the resolution while increasing framerates.

There are wide viewing angles on the IPS panel, which makes it easy to see even in bright settings. As a result of its low contrast ratio, it is not suitable for dark rooms.</p><p>There are no blur trails behind fast-moving objects because the display is exceptionally responsive, whether you play at 120Hz or 60Hz.

It also has an IPS panel but is an inch smaller than the Acer Nitro XV282K. However, it still offers good response times and VRR support despite its lack of HDMI 2.1 ports and 60Hz refresh rate. Due to its lack of USB ports, and lack of gaming features, the laptop doesn’t have many gaming capabilities. However, you do get built-in speakers, and you can also use Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture to display two input sources simultaneously, ideal for gaming while watching a movie or a show.</p><p>Go with the Acer if you can afford it. Due to its higher refresh rate and faster response times, it’s a much more efficient gaming monitor.
