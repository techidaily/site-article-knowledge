    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Sharpen-Your-Footage-The-Essentials-of-Video-Enhance-2-2"><a href="#Sharpen-Your-Footage-The-Essentials-of-Video-Enhance-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Sharpen Your Footage: The Essentials of Video Enhance 2.2"></a>Sharpen Your Footage: The Essentials of Video Enhance 2.2</h2><p>We’ve all experienced moments when the quality of a video isn’t as good as we’d like it to be. This is especially true; an unsteady hand, poor lighting, or low-quality technology can prevent all damage to a video.</p><p>You’re in luck if you’ve ever wondered how to improve video quality. We’re going to look over the finest video quality enhancers today. Many video enhancers have been launched so far, and you might find it difficult to choose one for you. Let’s begin:</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Video-enhancer-2-2"><a href="#Video-enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Video enhancer 2.2"></a>Video enhancer 2.2</h2><p>Video Enhancer is an application that uses the Super Resolution approach to boost video resolution. Super Resolution is a clever video upsizing method that uses information from neighboring frames to upsize the current frame. It gathers data. Therefore the more sequential frames processed, the greater the quality.</p><p>If the image in your video doesn’t change too quickly, information from multiple frames can be combined to create a larger image, showing details that would otherwise be concealed. However, no regular image resize&#x2F;resample techniques can achieve this quality because there isn’t enough information in one frame.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2"><a href="#How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?"></a>How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?</h3><p>Video Enhancers allow you to:</p><ul><li>Increase the resolution of your video with the Video Super-Resolution approach, which gives incredible quality by leveraging information from prior frames. At the same time, other resize methods only use information from one current frame. In addition, you may now convert SD video to HD!</li><li>Use VirtualDub’s hundreds of video filters to perform anything you want with your video, including deinterlacing, denoising, deshaking, color correction, sharpening, and visual effects.</li></ul><p>Because all filters and codecs function in independent threads, Video Enhancer is much faster than VirtualDub.</p><ul><li>Open any video that can be played on your system and re-compress it using any video codec (DirectShow, DMO, or Video for Windows) that you have installed.</li></ul><p>However, the step-by-step on how to use Video Enhancer 2.2</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the file</strong></p><p>Download Video Enhancer 2.2 and launch the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-1.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Once you have launched the software, import the file by clicking on ‘Browse’ to enhance video resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Edit the file</strong></p><p>After uploading the video file, click on ‘Add a filter,’ and a pop-up window shows various editing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-2.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You can create chains with any number of VirtualDub and Super Resolution filters to apply to your video in the Advanced user interface mode. You can filter your video before, after, in between, or even instead of scaling.</p><p>With over a hundred VirtualDub filters, you can edit your video, including deinterlace, denoise, deshake, color correction, visual effects, etc. Video Enhancer will most likely recognize your filters if you have VirtualDub installed.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Improve Video Resolution:</strong></p><p>Once you are done editing the video, close the pop-up window and click on ‘Add Super Resolution Resize’ and change the video resolution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-3.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Save the edited video file</strong></p><p>Click the Save video to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome.

If you have codecs from Video Enhancer’s favored list, it will advise which codec to use and at what bitrate. The recommended bitrate is determined by the final video resolution and the codec. After that, it displays its recommendations in the text; you must select the codecs and set the bitrate in its settings to finish the process.</p><h2 id="Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video"><a href="#Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video" class="headerlink" title="Alternative ways to enhance video"></a>Alternative ways to enhance video</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1172027/12108" target="_top" id="1172027">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1172027" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1172027/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

Filmora</h3><p>Compatibility: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is, without a doubt, the best video editor on the market, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>In the Filmora video editor, you’ll find some professional tools to help you increase video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort. Apart from the features that allow you to adjust video rotation effortlessly, this program is one of the most dependable.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import media files</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer.

You only need to arrange your clips on the timeline, choose background music, make opening titles and closing credits, or add interesting visual effects. Then, your videos are ready to be shared with the public.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Navigate to the project browser and choose the video clip you wish to modify. To begin the resizing process, click the crop button. You can also press the R key on your keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-8.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 2: Drag and resize your movie by dragging and repositioning the green rectangle. Stop pressing the resize button after you’re happy with the final size.</p><p>Step 3: View the video on the viewer to see how it looks after resizing.</p><h3 id="3-HDConvert"><a href="#3-HDConvert" class="headerlink" title="3.

However, huge video files may take some time to upload.</p><p>After the upload is complete, you can select various video resolutions, ranging from 240p to UHD 4K. If you wish to export your video files in Full HD, Ultra HD, or 4K resolution, you’ll need to upgrade to the premium edition of HDconvert.

The device offers a range of exciting features, including its generous battery life, outstanding appearance, enhanced telephoto camera, exceptionally smooth screen and innovative Face ID feature. Coming complete with a host of new and improved camera features, the iPhone X has helped Apple retain its reputation as one of the most pioneering and popular brands of all time. Let’s take a look at some of the0 <strong>best camera features</strong> the iPhone X has to offer right now.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The importance of depth</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to use portrait mode</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Video improvement</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera"><a href="#Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: TrueDepth Camera"></a>Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</h2><p> The phone has a brand new rear <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >camera with two lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a vertical orientation. This new orientation has been chosen to provide more space for the front-facing TrueDepth camera. This camera is tasked with powering the Face ID feature. The TrueDepth system also has a f&#x2F;2.2 7-megapixel camera for selfies. The feature means Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting are supported in front-facing mode. With Portrait Lighting, you can dynamically adjust your photo’s lighting with ease. TrueDepth uses an infrared emitter to project more than 30,000 in a recognised pattern onto users’ faces, before photographing the dots for analysis. The function is strengthened with a proximity sensor as well as an ambient light sensor which allows output light levels to be set.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-importance-of-depth"><a href="#Part-2-The-importance-of-depth" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The importance of depth"></a>Part 2: The importance of depth</h2><p> With previous versions of the iPhone Plus, the depth maps were only used to blur backgrounds and make subjects pop against them. However, the iPhone X takes the depth information from the two lenses as well as the efficiency of the A11 Bionic chip to offer outstanding new special effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/depth-iphone.jpg"                      alt="depth camera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094415/7443" target="_top" id="2094415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094415/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484950/16446" target="_top" id="1484950">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484950" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484950/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to use portrait mode"></a>Part 3: How to use portrait mode</h2><p> Portrait mode uses your iPhone X’s telephoto lens kit to create images with “bokeh”-esque backgrounds and foregrounds. Portrait Lighting also comes as part of the Portrait Mode with the iPhone X, utilising both machine learning and the depth map of Portrait mode to add exceptional lighting effects to your photos in real time. When you shoot in Portrait mode, the wide-angle measures the difference between what it and the telephoto can see to offer a multi-point depth map. The depth map itself creates artificial depth of field.</p><p> There are many iOS 11 Camera app features available that will help you make the most of Portrait mode, including flash, filters, HDR and timed photos. You can even create a live-type Portrait photo by recording the screen of your device whilst in the Camera app.</p><p> To take a photo of a person in Portrait mode, take the following steps.</p><ul><li>Open your Camera app</li><li>Swipe to the Portrait settings</li><li>Stand between two to eight feet of your subject, allowing the face and body detection feature to identify your subject.</li><li>Follow the app’s prompts, which can include “Flash may help”, “move farther away”, and “more light required” amongst others.</li><li>The banner at the bottom of your screen will turn yellow once you have met the instructions</li><li>Swipe or tap the cube icons above your shutter button to change the lighting effects if needed.</li><li>To take your photo, press the shutter button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PortraitLighting.jpg"                      alt="portrait lighting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014859/22899" target="_top" id="2014859">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014859" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014859/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Video-improvement"><a href="#Part-4-Video-improvement" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video improvement"></a>Part 4: Video improvement</h2><p> The iPhone X is also noted for its first-class video shooting capabilities, including its 4K video feature. Though previous iterations of the iPhone were already rather adept at shooting in 4K, the new devices are even more impressive and have been favourably compared to the GH5 in terms of quality and clarity. The new device has been complimented for its vibrant colour profile and its ability to deliver 4K video that matches a wide range of leading DSLR and mirrorless cameras. It’s possible to capture video in 240fps slo-mo at 1080p and 4K at 60fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-improvement.JPG"                      alt="video improvement"                ></p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best iPhone Stabilizers for Video Shooting &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There are many great reasons for investing in the iPhone X if you are interested in carrying a high-end camera around in your pocket. The phone is the smallest yet to feature two 12MP rear-facing cameras, with the updated telephoto lens also being a big draw for many. The lens has been optically stabilised and had its aperture boosted to f&#x2F;2.4 from f&#x2F;2.8. The phone is now able to offer vastly superior performance in low-light conditions, with the sensor having been completely rebuilt and a brand new image signal processor offering stunning colours and textures. In fact, the phone is able to perform convincingly in low-light conditions even when there are multiple light sources competing.</p><p> The phone has also been praised for its wide range between light and dark colours.

Configurability</h3><p>Rigid script formatting risks making your story look and sound like all the stories that have used it in the past.</p><p>The same events, the same character archetypes, the same moves and submissions, and the same build-ups can quickly become boring.</p><p>The best storyboard templates have a structure that is created with the genre of the story in mind but gives the writer room to play around with their characters, setting, etc.</p><p>For example, when I’m writing a character who’s learning to write a book, I’d like to show her picking up references from nature and various other creative genres and coming back to change her style—not just research from the works of other writers.</p><p>Taking an unconventional approach to character development can seem counterproductive and time-consuming. However, a good script draft will allow the writer to do this without making the script unbalanced.</p><h3 id="5-Creative-Space"><a href="#5-Creative-Space" class="headerlink" title="5. Creative Space"></a>5. Creative Space</h3><p>Stiffness is a very common factor in most traditional screenplay formats.</p><p>A certain rigidity is good because it keeps the story structured and prevents writers from focusing too deeply on one aspect and neglecting the rest.</p><p>However, script templates should not be too restrictive in terms of creative freedom for the writer.</p><p>For example, an ideal screenwriting template should allow one character out of several to experience a different phase of character development than the others at any point in the plot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-5.jpg"                      alt="creative space"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087239/19272" target="_top" id="2087239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087239/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This prevents all characters from looking and sounding like they were cast from a similar mold and have no unique development of their own.</p><p>In addition, the best templates should allow screenwriters to adjust their plot development to write for feature films as well as series.</p><p>Common fictional tropes have already been adopted by thousands of screenwriters around the world. The job of a perfect template is to give you enough creative space to create a unique story from a traditional genre.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The services come with an app that is super-fast, simple, and secure to use. However, most users don’t know how to use the Telegram web version.</p><p>Then what if you cannot attend your phone while you are working? How to make the most use of the flexibility of the Telegram?</p><p>In this article, we’ll show you how to take full advantage of the <strong>Telegram Web version,</strong> along with step-by-step instructions to use it correctly. So, let’s dig right in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Telegram"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What Is Telegram?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s learn more about this useful tool we use every day for communication.</p><p>Telegram is a cross-platform, end-to-end encrypted instant messaging service with a focus on security and speed. The app was launched in 2013 by two brothers, Nikolai and Pavel Durov, and today it has over 500 million active monthly users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/telegram-app.jpg"                      alt="telegram app"                ></p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> As mentioned in the beginning, one of the best advantages of Telegram is that this communication service is compatible with computers, including Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. But this does not mean that the Android and iOS users are not out of luck, as Telegram has a dedicated app for both of these platforms.</p><p>However, if you don’t want to install Telegram Desktop on your PC, you can use the Telegram web version instead. You can do this in two ways:</p><ul><li>By visiting the Telegram official website and start communicating directly from the browser.</li><li>By installing the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram-for-chrome/djjkifoefibfoodilnhkmbhmadbgacni" >Telegram extension on the Chrome browser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ul><p>As to the Chrome extension, it is easy for you to install it in the browser by clicking the official link given above.

It delivers brilliantly on some key features visual professionals want including an impressive 31.5-inch display, an IPS LCD, HDR 10 support, high-level color accuracy and depth, and the latest in DisplayPort technology.</p><p> The BenQ SW320 monitor started making waves long before it hit the market. That’s because it proposed to offer premium visual rendering functionality for a quarter of the price of its nearest high-end competitor. At roughly $1500, the SW320 is a steal for visual professionals who are keen to improve their workflow while remaining on the cutting edge of their practice.</p><p> Its 3840 x 2160px 4K display does require a powerful graphics processor to reach peak performance. The good news is that the cost of high-level graphic processing is on a downward trajectory. With a top performing monitor like the BenQ SW320, professional photographers, videographers and graphic artists can work with colors and details that are on par with nature’s artistry and their lofty creative aspirations.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons"></a>BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons</h2><p> This monitor has many positives to tally. The most notable has to be its state-of-the-art input port technologies. It sports an HDMI 2.0 port, a DisplayPort 1.4 and a mini DisplayPort 1.4. These input sockets have the necessary bandwidth to support its 4k UHD screen, its high-fidelity color renditions and its HDR functionality.</p><p> Also worthy of note is its effective stand which lets users adjust the positioning of the screen for best viewing results. On its stand, the BenQ SW320 monitor can make a 20-degree upward tilt, a 45-degree right or left swivel, and a 90-degree pivot from landscape to portrait mode.</p><p> The swivel feature does fall short of what professional studio designers may require. A photographer who needs to swivel the monitor to show a colleague her work may find a 45-degree swivel insufficient.</p><p> Another significant downside has to do with uniformity across its screen. According to some testers, the SW320 shows noticeable color tints towards the edges when set to display all-white. This is perceptible even when its Brightness Uniformity feature is enabled. While uniformity is something most monitors fail to achieve 100%, it’s not out of place to expect that a monitor as powerful and as groundbreaking as the BenQ SW320 would succeed where others have not.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Design"><a href="#Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Design"></a>Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The design of the BenQ SW320 is ideal for Professional photographers. It has a minimal black finish with an optimal bezel size and a matte screen surface that minimizes harsh glare.</p><p> The SW320 also has the right support apparatus. As mentioned above, it ships with a very efficient stand that provides ample support for its relatively heavy bulk. It is also a VESA compatible monitor. This means that it has standardized slots designed to let it be mounted on a wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button.jpg"                      alt="benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The most novel design feature of the SW320 is the remote-control Puck which stows seamlessly in a round slot located at the base of its stand. The puck connects to the back of the monitor and is a great convenience utility. It has the right size and bulk to fit effortlessly into any visual professional’s workflow while providing quick access to OSD menus.</p><p> With so much going for it, the BenQ SW320 has yet another functional tool many pros are sure to appreciate. It comes with a Monitor Shading Hood that blocks stray light from altering the color accuracy of images on its screen.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.

Its HDMI 2.O port, Display port 1.4 and mini DisplayPort 1.4 are located at the lower back side of the monitor. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and an AC power cable slot also located at its lower back side. The HDMI 2.0 port enables HDR support while the DisplayPort 1.4 enables full 10-bit color displays. To access these ports conveniently, users need only swivel the monitor slightly in the clockwise direction until the input panel is plainly in view.</p><p> In addition to having the right input slots to support its high-level visual performance, the SW320 also has 2 USB 3.0 slots and one SD Card slot located on its left side. BenQ takes the guesswork out of using these input slots correctly by supplying the right cables. Furthermore, there’s a cable management hole built into its stand that makes keeping a tidy set up very easy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Color-Performance"><a href="#1-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1. Color Performance"></a>1. Color Performance</h4><p> High-level color performance is a major strong suit of the BenQ SW320. When it comes to the number of colors it can render, this monitor packs a powerful punch. It can display a staggering 1.07 billion colors in multiple color gamuts. It is also Technicolor certified for both color accuracy and consistency.</p><p> It supports 10-bit color display and a 14-bit color LUT, and can render 99% of the sRGB color gamut as well as 99% of the AdobeRGB color gamut. Its coverage of the AdobeRGB gamut is particularly significant because AdobeRGB has an extended blue and green gamut compared to sRGB. As a result, AdobeRGB is better at rendering colors from nature.</p><p> AdobeRGB and sRGB aside, this monitor also has additional built-in color modes such as Black and White, DCI-P3, HDR and CAD&#x2F;CAM.</p><p> What’s really impressive is how easy it is to compare images in 2 color modes on the SW320. With Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture settings, a professional photographer can compare images in different color modes side-by-side. Enabling the PIP&#x2F;PBP feature through the HotKey Puck or joystick activates BenQ’s proprietary GamutDuo. GamutDuo is the feature which supports this on-screen color-mode comparison feature.</p><p> The SW320’s HDR support is another remarkable color performance feature. High Dynamic Rate support makes it possible to render more colors in the black and white range. It’s an all-important feature of High-Definition TVs. With this feature, the SW320 can achieve picture brilliance on par with HD-TV sets and other screens designed for entertainment purposes. This level of image quality enables professionals to produce top-quality work while also advancing the realm of possibility for their craft.</p><h4 id="2-Calibration"><a href="#2-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="2. Calibration"></a>2. Calibration</h4><p> Though most powerful monitors have what it takes to render colors accurately, how well they achieve this level of performance will depend on how well and how often they’re calibrated. The same is true for the SW320 which supports external hardware calibration. BenQ has a proprietary color calibration software known as Palette Master Element. This software works well with a number of external calibration devices such as X-Rite, Spyder and Display Pro. Using the software and hardware together, the SW320 can be set to perform at optimal color fidelity and depth.</p><p> Before calibrating any BenQ SW320 straight out of the box, it’s a good idea to go over the individual performance report that ships with it. Each report is unique. It provides a reliable baseline for understanding and assessing an SW320’s performance over time. Beyond its utility, these reports are also a good indication of BenQ’s commitment to quality and excellence.</p><h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p> One could argue that the effectiveness of a device’s assembly manual is a good measure of how well it is designed. In this regard, the BenQ SW320 scores another homerun. Its illustrated assembly manual is easy to follow. This allows for a stress-free set up experience that’s bound to be reassuring to anyone who’s spent $1500 on a monitor.</p><p> In the assembly manual, each part is labelled and arrows are used effectively to show how parts fit together. This clear sequencing means that most users can assemble their SW320s themselves. Granted its assembly manual makes setting up easy, there’s no shame in asking for help and doing some research. The SW320’s Monitor Shading Hood in particular, may prove a bit more difficult to assemble than the rest of the unit.</p><h4 id="4-Highlighted-Features"><a href="#4-Highlighted-Features" class="headerlink" title="4. Highlighted Features"></a>4. Highlighted Features</h4><p> Getting to know the strengths of the BenQ SW320 monitor is much like peeling back the layers of an onion. Many of its coolest features are nested within others and may not be apparent unless discussed. One such strength is the fact that due to its IPS LCD panel, the SW320 can display colors consistently at up to 178 degrees. This means that color depth and accuracy remain unchanged when this monitor is viewed from wide horizontally and vertically angles. This is certainly great for multi-viewer situations and in a way, compensates for the somewhat limited swivel angle of the SW320.</p><p> The Delta-E(ΔE) figures for this monitor are also very impressive and provide a sense of the high-level color fidelity it delivers consistently. Delta-E represents the difference between the color requested and the actual color rendered by the monitor. In general, figures under 2.0 are considered very good. According to some testers, the SW320 consistently scores a Delta-E that’s less than 1.2. This means that in many color modes, this monitor renders colors that are very true to what’s expected.</p><p> One last feature worth highlighting is the HotKey Puck’s custom option. It takes quick Display Menu access to a whole new level. While it is set by default to lead to standard menu options like Display, Color Adjustment and PIP&#x2F;PBP, the buttons on the Puck can actually be set to any functionality depending on what a user prefers. This includes custom color calibrations and any other custom settings a user may need in her workflow.</p><h4 id="5-Responsiveness"><a href="#5-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="5.Responsiveness"></a>5.Responsiveness</h4><p> As far as responsiveness goes, the SW320 is an okay performer. Its IPN LCD panel has a best response rate of 5ms. While this is great for rendering HD pictures and HD Video editing, it makes this monitor unsuited for quick-action gaming. Gaming monitors tend to have TN LCD panels precisely because they afford an excellent 1ms response rate that ensures screen-tearing and stuttering are minimized.</p><p> With its 5ms response rate, the SW320 may experience noticeable image rendering failures if used for fast-action gaming. For the most part however, this monitor performs exceedingly well for professional image processing and alright for minimal gaming use. It is worth emphasizing that the BenQ SW320 monitor is specifically designed to be used by visual design professionals. In light of this, its 5ms response rate is more than sufficient.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036481/19272" target="_top" id="2036481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036481/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> We can all agree that the BenQ SW320 has an impressive roll of positives. Assessed by any standard, it performs superbly and delivers many pleasant surprises to boot.</p><p> With this monitor, users need not worry about being hampered by outdated hardware any time soon. The BenQ SW320 comes with the latest in display and input port technologies. Far from being left behind, the BenQ may up the demand for PCs that have powerful GPUs and the latest output ports.</p><p> For professional photographers, videographers and Graphic Designers, the SW320 is a dream. At an affordable price bracket of $1450 - $1500, this monitor puts state-of-the-art color processing features within reach. And with proprietary features like GamutDuo and Palette Master Element, Visual Professionals can optimize their workflow significantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-comprehensive-motion-dynamics-synopsis-for-2024/"><u>[New] Comprehensive Motion Dynamics Synopsis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-for-attaching-tunes-in-instagram-media-for-2024/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step for Attaching Tunes in Instagram Media for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-online-websites-for-acquiring-thrones-rhythms/"><u>2024 Approved Essential Online Websites for Acquiring Thrones Rhythms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-green-frameworks-30plus-downloads-that-transform-your-videography-skills/"><u>2024 Approved Green Frameworks 30+ Downloads That Transform Your Videography Skills</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ideal-steadicam-pairings-with-premium-dslr-cameras/"><u>2024 Approved Ideal Steadicam Pairings with Premium DSLR Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-key-steps-to-ace-zoom-with-a-chromebook/"><u>2024 Approved Key Steps to Ace Zoom with a Chromebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-podcast-promotion-unlocked-the-seo-guide-to-top-spotings/"><u>2024 Approved Podcast Promotion Unlocked The SEO Guide to Top Spotings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quadcopter-showdown-dji-pro-and-hero-4-black/"><u>2024 Approved Quadcopter Showdown DJI Pro and Hero 4 Black</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reviving-your-windows-photo-viewer-approaches-for-w10-enthusiasts/"><u>2024 Approved Reviving Your Windows Photo Viewer Approaches for W10 Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revolutionize-note-taking-with-mematic-app/"><u>2024 Approved Revolutionize Note-Taking with Mematic App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transformative-techniques-applying-luts-for-dynamic-effects-in-after-effects/"><u>2024 Approved Transformative Techniques Applying LUTs for Dynamic Effects in After Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-blog.techidaily.com/free-conversion-of-mp4-files-to-mkv-format-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Free Conversion of MP4 Files to MKV Format: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-playback-errors-with-netflix-on-an-lg-tv-proven-techniques/"><u>How to Resolve Playback Errors with Netflix on an LG TV - Proven Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-gigglegraphics-eyecatchermemes/"><u>In 2024, GiggleGraphics EyeCatcherMemes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/sony-cat-s42-tough-phone-assessment-superior-durability-meets-moderate-performance/"><u>Sony CAT S42 Tough Phone Assessment: Superior Durability Meets Moderate Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/top-10-sites-to-download-copyright-free-meditation-music/"><u>Top 10 Sites to Download Copyright-Free Meditation Music</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-best-vr-game-engines-of-2023/"><u>Unveiling the Best VR Game Engines of 2023</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

And there are users feedback to forums that problem appears when enabling deghosting when batch processing in Aurora HDR. So, we are here to recommend some alternatives that you can use.</p><h3 id="1-Luminance-HDR"><a href="#1-Luminance-HDR" class="headerlink" title="1. Luminance HDR"></a>1.

After launching the application, look for the “Browse” button on the toolbar at the bottom. You may find out what’s hot or featured across several categories. Another option to find a podcast is to type its name into the “search” section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/listen-to-podcasts-on-your-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="search and browse option in apple podcast app"                ></p><p>When the results appear, tap on your chosen item to view more details.

Take a Screenshot using iPhone X tips and tricks"></a>1. Take a Screenshot using iPhone X tips and tricks</h4><p>Are you used to taking screenshots pressing the side button and the home button? What will you do with your iPhone X? It has no home button. Forget all your worries as the iPhone X tips and tricks help in easing your worries instantly. To take a screenshot on your iPhone X, press the side button and the volume up button simultaneously. The rest of the working is exactly as you see in other iPhones.</p><h4 id="2-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset"></a>2. Hard Reset</h4><p>What, if your iPhone X becomes unresponsive? iPhone X tips and tricks help you to force hard reset the iPhone X by swiftly pressing the volume up button first, then pressing the volume down button, and finally pressing and holding the side button. Apart from holding the side button, do not hold any of the volume buttons. You can observe the Apple logo when you hold the side button for 10-15 seconds and leave it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iPhone-X-Hard-Reset-Buttons-min.png"                      alt="hard reset"                ></p><h4 id="3-Battery-Percentage"><a href="#3-Battery-Percentage" class="headerlink" title="3. Battery Percentage"></a>3. Battery Percentage</h4><p>The iOS doesn’t feature a default battery percentage display. But, the settings can be used to turn on the display for battery percentage. The iPhone X is different, the setting has been removed from this device but don’t you worry. Just from the right side of the notch, swipe down and the option is integrated into the control center.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iOS_battery_percentage.jpg"                      alt="battery percentage"                ></p><h4 id="4-Virtual-Home-Button"><a href="#4-Virtual-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="4. Virtual Home Button"></a>4. Virtual Home Button</h4><p>Are you missing the home button feature on your iPhone X device? Unfortunately, it is not really possible to bring it back physically but replicating the home button is definitely possible with the use of the software. So, what is the procedure to get a home button replica? Go to the general, click on the accessibility feature, then click on the assistive touch, and finally toggle it on. A virtual home button appears on the screen which you may modify to activate the shortcuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-home-button.jpg"                      alt="home button"                ></p><h4 id="5-Optimize-Face-Id"><a href="#5-Optimize-Face-Id" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimize Face Id"></a>5. Optimize Face Id</h4><p>However fast the face ID is, at times, it cannot match up with the touch ID. But, the process of face ID can be accelerated with right habits and settings.</p><p>Firstly, click on the settings and then on the display and brightness feature to ensure “raise to wake” feature is enabled to stop you from having to tap on the screen. Swipe the phone upside so that your face is not seen directly on the screen and the face id gets time to authenticate and when you look to unlock your iPhone with the face ID, it directly takes you to the home screen. You may click on settings and then passcode and face ID to find the “require attention for face ID” feature to unlock the phone without looking directly on the screen. These iPhone X tips and tricks can greatly help to optimize the face ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/settings-face-id2.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><h4 id="6-Quickly-Return-Home"><a href="#6-Quickly-Return-Home" class="headerlink" title="6. Quickly Return Home"></a>6. Quickly Return Home</h4><p>If there’s an opened app screen on your iPhone X, you may go back to the home screen by using the home indicator. And, if multiple app pages are opened on your device’s home screen, you may swipe from the bottom edge which takes you back to the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-indicator-iphone-x.jpg"                      alt="return home"                ></p><h4 id="7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera"><a href="#7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera" class="headerlink" title="7. Instantly Open the Camera"></a>7. Instantly Open the Camera</h4><p>Do you want to have the instant camera feature on your iPhone X? Just swipe from right to the left to disclose the camera. You may also 3D Touch the camera icon by pressing the lock screen icon for long. As you long press the lockscreen icon, the camera is revealed for you to take the snapshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-open-camera.jpg"                      alt="open camera"                ></p><h4 id="8-Activate-Siri"><a href="#8-Activate-Siri" class="headerlink" title="8. Activate Siri"></a>8. Activate Siri</h4><p>In order to access Siri, press the side button for long without giving any voice command and activate Siri.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><h4 id="9-Use-Reachability-Again"><a href="#9-Use-Reachability-Again" class="headerlink" title="9. Use Reachability Again"></a>9. Use Reachability Again</h4><p>Do you miss the reachability feature where the display would slide down to reach the icons with one hand on the top of the screen by just a double touch on the home button? Why miss, when you can get it? Yes, the feature has not been removed from the iPhone X but it has just been hidden. Go to the general settings, click on the accessibility feature and scroll down to interaction to enable the reachability. For using the reachability feature, on the home bar bottom of the screen instantly swipe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Accessibility.png"                      alt="Accessibility"                ></p><h4 id="10-Flip-Between-Recent-Apps"><a href="#10-Flip-Between-Recent-Apps" class="headerlink" title="10. Flip Between Recent Apps"></a>10. Flip Between Recent Apps</h4><p>This is a familiar iPhone X functionality but you might have missed it while setting up your device. It is common for all of us to go through the tutorial quickly and then get to the phone. Isn’t it? But, if you have still missed it, then, from the home screen swipe right on the gesture bar. Now, you can quickly get into flipping between suspended apps. Furthermore, if you have flipped to an app that was not the last opened app, you can swipe both left and right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-multitasking.jpg"                      alt="Flip Between Recent Apps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134492/18498" target="_top" id="2134492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134492/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Keeping the iPhone X tips and tricks in mind, you get to access all the new and more handy iPhone X device.

One of the most interesting things you can include in your videos is a time lapse clip. Time lapses are videos where time seems to rush by quickly. Time lapse videos are often of things like the sun setting or traffic in the city and they are usually created by placing your camera in a stable spot, like on a tripod, and either setting it to record a video or to take pictures at regular intervals.</p><p>A hyperlapse is a special type of time lapse video where the camera changes positions. When you make a time lapse video you leave your camera in one spot. You might set it up in the window of a vehicle or on top of something that moves, but the camera stays in the spot where you mount it. When you create a hyperlapse video you manually move your camera to different positions.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-A-Hyperlapse-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-A-Hyperlapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make A Hyperlapse Video"></a>How to Make A Hyperlapse Video</h2><p>Time lapse videos are everywhere. Television shows often use time lapses and hyperlapses to establish locations. These usually include city skylines or recognizable landmarks. Time lapse and hyperlapse videos have also become popular on YouTube, Instagram, and other social media sites. Often people are creating them on their phones. This article will explain how.</p><h4 id="1-Apps-for-Creating-Hyperlapse-Videos"><a href="#1-Apps-for-Creating-Hyperlapse-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Apps for Creating Hyperlapse Videos"></a>1. Apps for Creating Hyperlapse Videos</h4><p>There are several apps for creating time lapse videos, and any of them can be used to create hyperlapses as well. Here are two of the best:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-hyperlapse.JPG"                      alt="hyperlapse hyperlapse"                ></p><p><strong>Hyperlapse</strong> is also the name of an app created by Instagram for recording time lapse and hyperlapse videos. This app can record up to 45 minutes of footage and then compress it into a much shorter video. The thing that makes Hyperlapse especially good for hyperlapse videos is that it automatically helps to stabilize the footage you record while walking around. As Hyperlapse is an Instagram app all videos are cropped into square shapes. This app is only available for iOS devices.</p><p>Lapse It is a great app for users who want to have a lot of control over the look of their videos. Besides recording your hyperlapse video Lapse It allows you to do some editing, like trimming your clips or adding music and filters. You can even import hyperlapse videos recorded with other cameras into Lapse It. There is a free version of Lapse It and a ‘Pro’ version which has more features and costs $1.99. Both versions offer in-app purchases. Lapse It is available for both Android and iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-lapseit.JPG"                      alt="hyperlapse lapseit"                ></p><p>For more information on time lapse apps read the entry ‘Best Apps for Time Lapse Videos’.</p><h4 id="2-Hyperlapse-Videos-–-The-Long-Way"><a href="#2-Hyperlapse-Videos-–-The-Long-Way" class="headerlink" title="2. Hyperlapse Videos – The Long Way"></a>2. Hyperlapse Videos – The Long Way</h4><p>Some video creators prefer to create their hyperlapse videos from photographs they take outside of an app. This takes longer, but some people find it more rewarding. First, choose an interesting location to record your hyperlapse and decide on the path you are going to move along. Look at the frame of your first shot and pick out one detail, like a window on a building. When you move your camera try to keep that detail in the same part of your frame.</p><p>It may be helpful to set your phone up on a tripod or monopod to keep it at the right level and stop it from shaking while you take your photos. You could also place the handle of a selfie stick on the ground and use it as a monopod.</p><p>To create your hyperlapse you will need to take even steps and snap a photo every time you move. You will end up with a huge number of photos which you will need to edit and compile into a video.</p><p>It is a good idea to edit your photos in a program like Lightroom before importing them into a video editing program. In Lightroom you can edit only one image and apply the same specs to the rest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-followers-to-fame-on-instagram-expert-advice-and-real-outcomes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Followers to Fame on Instagram Expert Advice and Real Outcomes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-lightning-lens-work-a-guide-to-speedy-google-collage-creation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Lightning Lens Work A Guide to Speedy Google Collage Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-essential-analysis-delving-into-adobe-lightroom-for-android/"><u>[New] In 2024, Essential Analysis Delving Into Adobe Lightroom for Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-visual-quality-with-video-enhancer-v22-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Visual Quality with Video Enhancer V2.2 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-automatically-resize-videos-for-instagram-on-mac-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Automatically Resize Videos for Instagram on Mac, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-visionary-storylines-in-the-eight-genre-sphere/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Visionary Storylines in the Eight Genre Sphere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-skip-the-struggle-tips-on-avoiding-online-edgenuity-lessons-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Skip the Struggle Tips on Avoiding Online Edgenuity Lessons for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-rhythmic-convergence-crossfade-explained-simply/"><u>2024 Approved Rhythmic Convergence Crossfade Explained Simply</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-nokia-c12-pro-phone-pattern-lock-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Nokia C12 Pro Phone Pattern Lock without Factory Reset</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/step-by-step-srt-to-xmlssattml-mastery-guide/"><u>Step-by-Step SRT to XML/SSA/TTML Mastery Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-missing-camera-in-windows-11/"><u>Troubleshooting Missing Camera in Windows 11</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136622/26400" target="_top" id="2136622">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136622" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136622/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>
