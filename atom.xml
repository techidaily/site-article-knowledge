The device offers a range of exciting features, including its generous battery life, outstanding appearance, enhanced telephoto camera, exceptionally smooth screen and innovative Face ID feature. Coming complete with a host of new and improved camera features, the iPhone X has helped Apple retain its reputation as one of the most pioneering and popular brands of all time. Let’s take a look at some of the0 <strong>best camera features</strong> the iPhone X has to offer right now.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The importance of depth</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to use portrait mode</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Video improvement</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera"><a href="#Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: TrueDepth Camera"></a>Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</h2><p> The phone has a brand new rear <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >camera with two lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a vertical orientation. This new orientation has been chosen to provide more space for the front-facing TrueDepth camera. This camera is tasked with powering the Face ID feature. The TrueDepth system also has a f&#x2F;2.2 7-megapixel camera for selfies. The feature means Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting are supported in front-facing mode. With Portrait Lighting, you can dynamically adjust your photo’s lighting with ease. TrueDepth uses an infrared emitter to project more than 30,000 in a recognised pattern onto users’ faces, before photographing the dots for analysis. The function is strengthened with a proximity sensor as well as an ambient light sensor which allows output light levels to be set.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-importance-of-depth"><a href="#Part-2-The-importance-of-depth" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The importance of depth"></a>Part 2: The importance of depth</h2><p> With previous versions of the iPhone Plus, the depth maps were only used to blur backgrounds and make subjects pop against them. However, the iPhone X takes the depth information from the two lenses as well as the efficiency of the A11 Bionic chip to offer outstanding new special effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/depth-iphone.jpg"                      alt="depth camera"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to use portrait mode"></a>Part 3: How to use portrait mode</h2><p> Portrait mode uses your iPhone X’s telephoto lens kit to create images with “bokeh”-esque backgrounds and foregrounds. Portrait Lighting also comes as part of the Portrait Mode with the iPhone X, utilising both machine learning and the depth map of Portrait mode to add exceptional lighting effects to your photos in real time. When you shoot in Portrait mode, the wide-angle measures the difference between what it and the telephoto can see to offer a multi-point depth map. The depth map itself creates artificial depth of field.</p><p> There are many iOS 11 Camera app features available that will help you make the most of Portrait mode, including flash, filters, HDR and timed photos. You can even create a live-type Portrait photo by recording the screen of your device whilst in the Camera app.</p><p> To take a photo of a person in Portrait mode, take the following steps.</p><ul><li>Open your Camera app</li><li>Swipe to the Portrait settings</li><li>Stand between two to eight feet of your subject, allowing the face and body detection feature to identify your subject.</li><li>Follow the app’s prompts, which can include “Flash may help”, “move farther away”, and “more light required” amongst others.</li><li>The banner at the bottom of your screen will turn yellow once you have met the instructions</li><li>Swipe or tap the cube icons above your shutter button to change the lighting effects if needed.</li><li>To take your photo, press the shutter button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PortraitLighting.jpg"                      alt="portrait lighting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Video-improvement"><a href="#Part-4-Video-improvement" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video improvement"></a>Part 4: Video improvement</h2><p> The iPhone X is also noted for its first-class video shooting capabilities, including its 4K video feature. Though previous iterations of the iPhone were already rather adept at shooting in 4K, the new devices are even more impressive and have been favourably compared to the GH5 in terms of quality and clarity. The new device has been complimented for its vibrant colour profile and its ability to deliver 4K video that matches a wide range of leading DSLR and mirrorless cameras. It’s possible to capture video in 240fps slo-mo at 1080p and 4K at 60fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-improvement.JPG"                      alt="video improvement"                ></p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best iPhone Stabilizers for Video Shooting &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There are many great reasons for investing in the iPhone X if you are interested in carrying a high-end camera around in your pocket. The phone is the smallest yet to feature two 12MP rear-facing cameras, with the updated telephoto lens also being a big draw for many. The lens has been optically stabilised and had its aperture boosted to f&#x2F;2.4 from f&#x2F;2.8. The phone is now able to offer vastly superior performance in low-light conditions, with the sensor having been completely rebuilt and a brand new image signal processor offering stunning colours and textures. In fact, the phone is able to perform convincingly in low-light conditions even when there are multiple light sources competing.</p><p> The phone has also been praised for its wide range between light and dark colours. The Face ID function has proved to be incredibly secure, unlike earlier facial recognition systems which could easily be tricked by with the use of photographs or videos. It’s now possible to be more creative than ever with your iPhone’s camera whilst benefiting from a wealth of robust security features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-thorough-evaluation-hero4-black-innovations/"><u>2024 Approved  Thorough Evaluation  Hero4 Black Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tomtom-bandit-camera-review-the-latest/"><u>2024 Approved  TomTom Bandit Camera Review  The Latest</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-making-your-mark-with-instagram-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Making Your Mark with Instagram Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-on-nokia-c32-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Nokia C32 without Anyone Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-free-avi-video-rotation-16-top-picks-for-windows-mac-android-iphone-and-online-platforms/"><u>Updated In 2024, Free AVI Video Rotation 16 Top Picks for Windows, MAC, Android, iPhone, and Online Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-iphone-passcode-again-unlock-iphone-6-without-passcode-now-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Forgot iPhone Passcode Again?

Design Accessories"></a>1.  Design Accessories</h4><p> If we talk about looks then GoPro Hero4 can be rated as one of the most awesome device and its waterproof housing make it more suitable for adventure sports activities. It comes with so many accessories that help in easy and efficient recording. You can see WiFi and camera recording status on two small slits that are attached to front portion of this camera near the LED screen. On right side of this screen you will find a settings button that also allows users to make settings for Wi-Fi connectivity. The latest design of Hero4 Black makes battery swiping feature much easier and allows users to record videos for longer duration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-hero-black-4.jpg"                      alt="gopro hero black 4"                ></p><p> One of the most interesting features of Hero4 Black is its 4K video resolution ability that can be generated at maximum frame rate of 30fps. You can edit the videos generated by GoPro Hero4 black device and customized results can be obtained. Some of the additional but impressive features of this GoPro device are video mode selection facility, image sharpness, color contrast and low light performance. In case if you want to record videos at 1080p then it is possible to get maximum frame rate of 120fps whereas slow motion recording can also be enabled. For 720p recording you will be glad to access the maximum frame rate of 240fps. Most of users love to enjoy time lapse stitching with GoPro Hero4 Black device.</p><p> On the other side, if we talk about GoPro Hero4 Black picture quality then its f&#x2F;2.8 lens can offer 170 degree wide point of view so that every specific detail can be captured so clearly. It is possible to make selections between 5MP, 7Mp and 12MP modes for stills whereas some users will love to take advantage from night mode and burst mode.</p><p> This device is capable enough to replace most of costly DSLR devices in market and is one step ahead of highest quality mobile phones. You will be able to take benefits from its color modes, exposure tuning, white balance and ISO selectivity. Only drawback of Hero4 Black is its small battery life that can assist you only for one hour when you have enabled Wi-Fi feature.</p><h4 id="2-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.  Connectivity"></a>2.  Connectivity</h4><p> While talking about all awesome features of GoPro Hero4 Black, how can be forgot to include its connectivity. This device is enabled with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity facility and users can control almost all features from mobile devices using GoPro application. With this advanced software application you can easily preview or playback your recording and once finalized then it can be easily shared on social media websites like Instagram, Facebook as well as via email. If you make use of Bluetooth feature instead of Wi-Fi then its battery can serve you little longer. The smart recording feature allows users to control almost 50 cameras simultaneously at the maximum distance of 600’ line of sight. In the whole GoPro series, GoPro Hero4 Black was the first device that possesses Wi-Fi along with Bluetooth connectivity.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-life-and-Storage-capacity"><a href="#3-Battery-life-and-Storage-capacity" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery life and Storage capacity"></a>3.  Battery life and Storage capacity</h4><p> This device comes with a 1160mAh battery that can serve you for 1 hour 30 minutes if you are recording at 1080p resolution where frame rate is 30fps, but note that Wi-Fi is disabled. In case if you are using Wi-Fi as well as Smart Phone application then this recording time will naturally fall by 15 minutes. If you want to use this device for full day shooting then i8t is good to go for Wi-Fi disabled mode and bring multiple batteries with you on tour.</p><p> If we talk about the storage offered by GoPro Hero5 black then the bad news is that it does not offer any internal storage but the great feature is that external MicroSD card storage can be extended up to 64 GB. If you are recording in UHD mode at 30fps then it can record maxi8mum up to 2 hours and 20 minutes whereas in case of 1080p at 30 fps you can enjoy long hour recording up to 4 hours 40 minutes.</p><h4 id="4-Live-Streaming"><a href="#4-Live-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="4.  Live Streaming"></a>4.  Live Streaming</h4><p> The coolest option available with GoPro Hero4 Black is its ability to serve for live streaming needs. It is much easier to transfer videos from Camera to smartphone as well as tablet using Wi-Fi connectivity but you need to run Meerkat or LiveStream application on your portable device to make this connection. It will help users to deliver content directly to websites. LiveStream application works perfectly on iOS devices but the videos go to live streamed channel with a delay of 10 seconds at max.</p><p> If you love to share your content online then Hero4 Black could be one of the most superior devices for you.

It is sold in single color scheme of white, red and black which can be termed as its signature colors. With a weight of around 190g, Bandit is not part of small action cameras. It feels like a tank, having a cylindrical body which can be termed as the strongest of all action cameras in the market. The material which surrounds its body is ABS plastic, and its fit and finish is excellent and thus there is no doubt that its build quality is extremely impressive. It has got a LCD screen which is situated at top of Bandit camera and is used only for navigating, changing and viewing menus, settings and other in-camera features with the help of a panel of 4 action buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tomtom-bandit-design.jpg"                      alt="tomtom-bandit-design"                ></p><p> The bottom of the camera has a clever mounting system which allows rotating the camera approximately 180 degrees and rotating mechanism is quite tighter so you can be relieved of its safety.</p><p> Both sides of Bandit are curved, which allows to grip it properly while holding and at the same time the red piece wrapping around it, gives a sporty and stylish outer look.</p><p> The back of the camera includes a module which is completely removable as it contains USB, slot for microSD and a red record button. This means you can simply plug in the whole module in your laptop and charge it when needed. This eliminates the need of carrying and charging cables. Thus, bandit allows wireless charging.</p><p> In combination with its dive lens cover, the camera is fully waterproof. Just a cover can make it waterproof, without making it bulky.</p><h4 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h4><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Specification</strong></th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Review Price</strong></td><td>Adventure Pack: £239.99; bike pack: £279.99 (MSRP)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>190g &#x2F; 6.7oz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dimension</strong></td><td>94x38x52mm &#x2F; 3.7×1.5×2.0”</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Image sensor</strong></td><td>CMOS with 16Mpixels</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video format</strong></td><td>.mp4,</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video mode</strong></td><td>Time-lapse 1080p 30fps &#x2F; 4k 30fps (Capture every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 seconds)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame rates</strong></td><td>4k 15fps; 2.7k 30fps; 1080p 60&#x2F;30fps; 720p 120&#x2F;60fps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scene mode</strong></td><td>Auto&#x2F;Underwater&#x2F;Night&#x2F;Bright</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Photo modes</strong></td><td>Burst 16 MP &#x2F; 8 MP (Capture 10 continuous frames in 1 or 2 seconds)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audio</strong></td><td>Built-in microphone, external microphone supported</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>MicroSD card for Class 10 (not included)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>1900mAh, Up to 3 hours at 1080p 30FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Slow motion</strong></td><td>1080P x 2; 720P x 4; WVGA x 6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sensors</strong></td><td>Built-in GPS and motion sensor for tracking heart rates</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Photo quality</strong></td><td>16MP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB 3.0, APP</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons"></a>Pros and Cons</h4><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Robust and attractive design, catchy to the eyes</td><td>4K only available at 15 frames&#x2F;sec</td></tr><tr><td>LCD display makes configuration easy through vast and varied features</td><td>No professional-grade video data rate options</td></tr><tr><td>Remote control via Smartphone App</td><td>No digital image stabilization and LCD screen doesn’t support watching clips on device</td></tr><tr><td>Quick video editing capacity through the special features of app.</td><td>Needs separate lens cover for waterproofing</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless experience: Charging and data transfer without a cable</td><td>Bulky and thus requires mount to carry it along else it becomes difficult to carry it.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Accessories"><a href="#Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Accessories"></a>Accessories</h4><p> TomTom has launched the Bandit in two following packs:</p><p> A cheaper Adventure Pack which contains Backpack Mount and, A more expensive Bike Pack containing Flexible Handle Bar mount; Vented helmet mount; Remote Control</p><p> Accessories contained in the box:</p><ul><li>TomTom Bandit action camera</li><li>Adapter for GoPro Mounts</li><li>Removable Batt-Stick</li><li>Anti-Rotation Clip</li><li>Microphone Windshield</li><li>Splash-proof Lens cover</li><li>Dive Lens Cover to waterproof the camera</li><li>Basic Surface Mounts (1X1)</li></ul><p> Bandit may not come with quantities of accessories, but some of the them such as surface mounts and dive lens cover are included.</p><p> There are various other accessories which can simply alleviate your shooting experience.

Its slow motion capturing feature emphasizes your biggest emotions in slow motion.</p><p> Another impressive feature of Bandit is that it creates video of shots taken over a period of time.

You can select the frequency of shots that should be taken ranging from 5 to 60 seconds.

Its infrastructure impresses through its common module for USB and the battery which is completely removable. So you can remove it and plug it into your laptop and do the charging and transfering of clips at the same time.

Quik is a free application that would automatically create nicely edited videos within just a few minute’s time. The editing process is as simple as it can possibly get; all you have to do is selecting the videos or pictures which you would like to show in the movie from the library and Quik is going to do the rest. However, you can only use the images and videos which are stored in your phone’s library. You can also mix the GoPro footage with those of your phones if you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quik-gopro.jpeg"                      alt="gopro editing apps Quik"                ></p><h3 id="2-Antix"><a href="#2-Antix" class="headerlink" title="2.Antix"></a>2.Antix</h3><p>Antix is a special kind of application that makes use of the motion sensors of your smartphone in order to detect when some exciting action is happening. However, the app developers still haven’t revealed what exactly is deemed exciting by this app. It would recommend the key scenes by a comparison of the recorded motion footage from your phone with the help of the video stream of your GoPro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Antix.jpg"                      alt="best gopro app Antix"                ></p><h3 id="3-KineMaster"><a href="#3-KineMaster" class="headerlink" title="3. KineMaster"></a>3. KineMaster</h3><p>This video editor is multiple timeline editing. The slow-motion editor can empower the details of your exciting moments, which means viewers can have more engagement with your GoPro videos. The power of this app derives from an algorithm that would help you to find the most exciting snippets from your recordings and edit them promptly into shareable bits. You can also choose to add any background sound to your video wither from the mic of your phone or from a preselected list of licensed tracks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-green-screen.jpg"                      alt="gopro editing apps KineMaster"                ></p><h3 id="4-PowerDirector-for-Android"><a href="#4-PowerDirector-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="4. PowerDirector for Android"></a>4. PowerDirector for Android</h3><p>Comes with loads of features like timeline video editing, cool video effects, slo-mo, a photo-video editor, and lots more. This app is all you need to share cool videos on Vine or YouTube. The footage from your action cam can be edited just like you do it on Magisto or Final Cut. Now you can rotate, trip, split, and even create the coolest slo-mo videos just like GoPro. All you have to do is add the videos for your timeline and start editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-android.jpg"                      alt="best gopro app PowerDirector"                ></p><h3 id="5-Camera-MX"><a href="#5-Camera-MX" class="headerlink" title="5.

You can now shoot some amazing moments with your phone and just import the recordings. The video camera app is very useful for quickly deleting unwanted scenes and arranging the clips. You can even manually alter the brightness, colors, and contrasts of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Camera-MX.jpg"                      alt="gopro editing apps Camera MX"                ></p><hr><h2 id="Part-2-GoPro-Video-Editing-App-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-GoPro-Video-Editing-App-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: GoPro Video Editing App for iPhone"></a>Part 2: GoPro Video Editing App for iPhone</h2><h3 id="6-Splice"><a href="#6-Splice" class="headerlink" title="6. Splice"></a>6. Splice</h3><p>If more precise control is what you are after then you need to go for Splice. This iOS app functions like a regular video editing app that lets the user choose more than a single backing track, allows manual transitions, records voiceover, and even adds filters to the videos and images of the timeline. It goes without saying that Splice is one of the best free and easy to use the iOS app with which you can do your basic GoPro editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splice.JPG"                      alt="gopro editing apps Splice"                ></p><h3 id="7-iMovie"><a href="#7-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="7. iMovie"></a>7. iMovie</h3><p>Owners of iPhone and iPads are surely familiar with this light and powerful video editor which allows you to professionally edit your GoPro footage no matter where you are. You need to copy the footage to your iOS device and launch the app; now you can select the footage from your ‘Projects’ tab and start editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-ios.jpg"                      alt="gopro video editing app imovie"                ></p><h3 id="8-GoFix"><a href="#8-GoFix" class="headerlink" title="8. GoFix"></a>8. GoFix</h3><p>Though your action camera would allow you to take photos in situations in which most other cameras won’t allow, your photos are going to be a bit distorted because of the fisheye effect on GoPro. Though many of us prefer the fisheye look, you can always choose to do away with it by using the GoFix app. With the GoFix app, you no longer need to worry about those curved horizons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/gofix.jpg"                      alt="gopro editing apps GoFix"                ></p><h3 id="9-Myk-for-GoPro-Control-Audio"><a href="#9-Myk-for-GoPro-Control-Audio" class="headerlink" title="9.

It indicates that it doesn’t matter for how long what you value has been around. And photography is no exception. It has been around for ages, with its physical image being the most valued aspect. Photo-montage is one mode of representing reality in the form of photographs.</p><p>It has come a long way from printed form and is now scalability in the digital space. Currently, photomontage-making tools are available for quick mounting. But you also need perfection in this noble act, which is why tips and tricks before making a photo mount are ideal. Let’s dive in below for more emphasis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-a-photo-montage-1.jpg"                      alt="how to make a photo montage"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-photomontage"><a href="#What-is-a-photomontage" class="headerlink" title="What is a photomontage?"></a>What is a photomontage?</h2><p>Unlike the typical photograph with a single pic, a photomontage encompasses several photos collaged together. It doesn’t matter the number of photos it contains. You can also use a variety of locations to take photos. Way back, photographers composed photo montage images by cutting, gluing, and arranging pieces together. However, the advent of computers has shifted the dimension of making a photo montage. Several apps are available for not only montaging your photos, but also editing them for a splendid outcome.</p><h2 id="Things-to-pay-attention-to-before-making-a-PhotoMontage"><a href="#Things-to-pay-attention-to-before-making-a-PhotoMontage" class="headerlink" title="Things to pay attention to before making a PhotoMontage"></a>Things to pay attention to before making a PhotoMontage</h2><p>Let’s check out what to consider in the quest to make a photo montage.</p><h3 id="i-What’s-your-subject"><a href="#i-What’s-your-subject" class="headerlink" title="i) What’s your subject?"></a>i) What’s your subject?</h3><p>Ask yourself what you intend to express with your photomontage.

Plan out how many photos you want to include in your montage as well.</p><h3 id="ii-Keep-it-real"><a href="#ii-Keep-it-real" class="headerlink" title="ii) Keep it real"></a>ii) Keep it real</h3><p>Don’t exaggerate your work, but keep it real.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Your-Signature-Starts-Here-Free-Modifiable-Logos-to-Define-Brands"><a href="#Your-Signature-Starts-Here-Free-Modifiable-Logos-to-Define-Brands" class="headerlink" title="Your Signature Starts Here: Free, Modifiable Logos to Define Brands"></a>Your Signature Starts Here: Free, Modifiable Logos to Define Brands</h2><p>A logo represents your brand and gives the audience a sense of identity; brand identity is a key factor in brand building and growth. For example, the main difference between cloth vendors&#x2F;manufacturers is brand identity. In a simple term, “what makes your brand different from the competitors?” – your logo is one of the answers. <strong>Free logo templates</strong> are easy to use, customizable, and applicable for brand promotion and recognition. Although most <strong>logo templates</strong> are customizable, some are not editable. This article talks about editable and not editable free logo templates. Learn more below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Free-logo-templates-Editable"><a href="#Part-1-Free-logo-templates-Editable" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Free logo templates (Editable)"></a>Part 1: Free logo templates (Editable)</h2><p>Editable logo templates differ from other templates because they support modification and diversification. Customizing a template gives total access and quality creation in your care. In short, if it is editable, you remove, add, and save a modified version of a logo template. All logo makers are not free or easy to edit; however, some editable free logo templates include:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.canva.com/create/logos/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></li></ol><p>Canva is an essential logo template maker. You can do more with the editable logo template creator because it contains several collections of logo templates that serve as the basis for your logo creation. You may not necessarily subscribe to the premium package if you do not need the premium files. You can learn more about Canva, especially how to create logo templates, from the official website.</p><p>The website gives full access to all users, educating them on how to use the Canva tool for better logo making. Canva AI algorithm suggests designs based on your history. For example, you locate resourceful raw collections for projects without much stress. The beautiful algorithm feature is important if you create more than one logo.</p><p>The Canva (free) feature includes free download (limited resolution), limited editing tools, and unlimited space work. You must create an account before accessing the official website editing tool since the software does not require an editor to make changes or customize a template.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/canva.jpg"                      alt="canva official homepage"                ></p><ol><li><strong>Adobe</strong></li></ol><p>Adobe has software for logo making and design; however, <a class="link"   href="https://express.adobe.com/express-apps/logo-maker/" >Adobe Create Logo Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an official website option, allows direct free logo making. You need not download or install the software before using Adobe Create from the page. Adobe has outstanding features that put it above the competition: vector graphics, scaling, and quality maintenance.</p><p>All designs come from a basic idea; with Adobe, you can amplify your idea into a captivating logo – this is possible with the vector graphics. Logos are naturally simple and small; however, if you need a high print logo for your company, especially a 3D inscription, you may need Adobe vector graphics. The vector graphics put you at a high resolution to size ratio: maintaining a quality resolution irrespective of the log size.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-express.jpg"                      alt="adobe logo maker"                ></p><p>Tips: Adobe also provides a lot of well-customized templates involving various styles and types.

The downloaded copies may be the basis of further graphics exploration. Not editable logo templates give high results when you use them for extended logo creation because they are available in the highest resolution.

Using a much slower shutter speed, photographs are taken over a longer time period, creating effects that are nothing short of enchanting.</p><p> Previously the preserve of those who could afford to invest in a top of the range SLR, this type of photography is now within reach of many more of us, thanks to improvement in iPhone camera’s technology. Want to know how? Read on.</p><h2 id="How-to-Take-Long-Exposure-Shots-on-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-Take-Long-Exposure-Shots-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to Take Long Exposure Shots on iPhone"></a>How to Take Long Exposure Shots on iPhone</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Section 1: Users on iOS 11</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Section 2: Not a user of iOS 11?</a></li></ul><p> When you take long exposure shots using a digital SLR, the physical shutter which captures the image stays open for longer. You can also fiddle with the aperture size, to make it easier to capture these images in different light levels. This process is meticulously replicated by the iPhone’s newest Photos app, so if you’re already on iOS 11, here’s how to use it:</p><h3 id="Users-on-iOS-11"><a href="#Users-on-iOS-11" class="headerlink" title="Users on iOS 11"></a>Users on iOS 11</h3><p> First of all, make sure Live Photos is switched on. Within the camera app, simply tap the circular button in the middle of the top menu bar to turn it on. Once activated, the button will turn yellow and the ‘live’ notification will be shown on screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-live-photo-on-iphone.jpg"                      alt="take-live-photo-on-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: imore</p><p> Next, take a live photo. This is a moving image, a bit like recording with your video camera, but much shorter. Try to keep the iPhone steady as you take your shot, and choose to shoot something that is continually moving, but with a relatively stable background. Something like cars going down a street is a great place to start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/long-exposure-effect-iphone.jpg"                      alt="long-exposure-effect-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: iPhoneMod</p><p> Now bring up your live photo within the Photos app and bring up the effects selector. You can see this either by tapping ‘details’ or by simply swiping up whilst viewing the photo. There are lots of effects you can apply to your live photo, but the one we’re looking for here is ‘long exposure’. Simply tap this and your clever iPhone will make all the adjustments necessary to produce an awesome pro-looking photograph using long exposure.</p><h3 id="Not-a-user-of-iOS-11"><a href="#Not-a-user-of-iOS-11" class="headerlink" title="Not a user of iOS 11?"></a>Not a user of iOS 11?</h3><p> If you don’t have iOS 11 yet (or can’t get it for your model), there is a way around this. Some developers have produced apps which mimic the extended shutter speed of Live Photos. This is achieved by combining multiple exposures of the same photograph, and then stitching them together with an overlain effect to create a simulated long exposure image.</p><p> There are a number of these apps available on the app store, each with its own set of pros and cons.

Here are some top tips for shooting better long exposure photos on iPhone:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a tripod:</strong> A simple tripod will avoid the inevitable shake, which can really spoil a good shot. Basic models don’t break the bank, and will step your shots up a level with ease.</li><li><strong>Get a good phone attachment:</strong> The last thing you want is for your iPhone to hit the deck while you’re trying to attach it to the tripod, so choose an attachment system that is secure and easy to use.</li><li><strong>Use your ear buds:</strong> Using your white Apple earbuds with ‘volume shutter’ turned on allows you to activate the shutter without touching the phone. This further reduces the risk of a wobble and subsequently ruined shot.</li><li><strong>Photograph moving objects:</strong> Your Live Photo will translate better into a long exposure shot if you have something obviously moving in the image. Having a moving object against stationery surrounds works really well.</li></ul><p> This feature is one of the most exciting and interesting uses of Live Photos to date, and is well worth checking out if you haven’t done so already.</p><h3 id="What-should-you-capture-with-your-long-exposure-iPhone-shots"><a href="#What-should-you-capture-with-your-long-exposure-iPhone-shots" class="headerlink" title="What should you capture with your long exposure iPhone shots?"></a>What should you capture with your long exposure iPhone shots?</h3><p> Long exposure shots are magical, giving a dreamy, almost ethereal quality to everyday situations. No doubt you’ll find your own amazing things to shoot, but to get you started, why not try a long exposure iPhone shot of:</p><ul><li><strong>Flowing water:</strong> Live near a river or, even better, by the ocean? Perfect, because moving water can become truly enchanting when shot on long exposure. Play around with the time of day, light available and exposure length to capture some really gorgeous scenes.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flowing-water-long-exposure.jpg"                      alt="flowing-water-long-exposure"                ></p><p> Image resource: Photography Mad</p><ul><li><strong>Light trails:</strong> Light is everywhere, and if you take your iPhone camera long exposure trick out of the house at night, you’ll find some amazing opportunities to shoot. Cars on the highway, Ferris wheels at the fair and even the stars in the sky can become something amazing with a longer exposure.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/long-trails-exposure.jpg"                      alt="long-trails-exposure"                ></p><p> Image resource: WallDevil</p><ul><li><strong>Motion blur:</strong> To give the sense of something really moving fast, a motion blur can be a captivating effect. From vehicles on the city street to a galloping horse, allowing the moving object to blur whilst everything else around it stays in focus can add a dose of drama to your shots.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/motion-blur-long-exposure.jpg"                      alt="motion-blur-long-exposure"                ></p><p> Image resource: Digital Photo Secrets</p><ul><li><strong>Low light photography:</strong> With a longer exposure, things which were previously un-snappable are suddenly within your grasp. Beautiful fountains at night, bridges, buildings… anything which would previously have been little more than a shadow can now become part of your collection, simply by extending the exposure length.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/low-light-long-exposure.jpg"                      alt="low-light-long-exposure"                ></p><p> Image resource: Nikonites</p><p> Play around, try different things and get to know how variations in settings can change the outcome of your shots. Tinkering with exposure length is great fun, and will almost certainly result in some totally Facebook-worthy additions to your gallery.</p><h2 id="To-conclude"><a href="#To-conclude" class="headerlink" title="To conclude"></a>To conclude</h2><p> Using a digital SLR is looking less and less appealing these days, as Apple push the boundaries of what a phone can do ever further. If you’re not using a device that supports Live Photos, try a workaround using a specifically developed app so that you can join in the fun too.</p><p> With the iPhone camera long exposure shots could really up your game on social media. Whether you’re a budding travel photographer, a wannabe stock photo entrepreneur or simply an Instagram lover who wants to impress their friends, have a play with the technology available to you and see what you can create. Long exposure shots are massively popular right now, so grab your iPhone and get snapping!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-voice-transformation-visionaries-morphvox-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  Voice Transformation Visionaries  MorphVOX Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-thwarting-video-stops-in-photobooth-recordings/"><u>2024 Approved  Thwarting Video Stops in Photobooth Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-track-lost-friends-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Track Lost Friends on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/seeing-beyond-the-ordinary-with-ar/"><u>Seeing Beyond the Ordinary with AR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-converting-aiff-files-into-mp3-insights-tools-and-tips-for-enthusiasts/"><u>In 2024, Converting AIFF Files Into MP3 Insights, Tools, and Tips for Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-lost-data-from-infinix-note-30i-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>Recover lost data from Infinix Note 30i</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-art-of-analytic-assessment-in-the-youtube-sphere/"><u>In 2024, The Art of Analytic Assessment in the YouTube Sphere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-the-potential-of-mac-for-top-tier-ootd-tiktoks/"><u>In 2024, Unlock the Potential of Mac for Top-Tier OOTD TikToks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-best-places-to-find-3d-silver-and-gold-lettering-effects/"><u>[New] Best Places to Find 3D Silver and Gold Lettering Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-your-vivo-v29-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Reset your Vivo V29 Lock Screen Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-vivo-y27s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Vivo Y27s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-your-youtube-potential-through-brand-partnerships/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Your YouTube Potential Through Brand Partnerships</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/snapcraft-universe-top-8-photo-connector-for-2024/"><u>SnapCraft Universe  Top 8 Photo Connector for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This desktop program can change your live voice to match your desired online character, whether voice chatting on Skype and Discord or playing on Steam and Valorant. But if you’re looking to use MorphVOX, it’s paramount to know that this program comes in two packages, the Junior and Pro versions. So, what’s the difference between the Junior and Pro versions? Let’s find out!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.</p><p>You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.</p><p>However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That’s because it’s pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it’s an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-1.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It’s super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.</p><p>But the Junior version doesn’t come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.</p><p>Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files.

In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to use MorphVOX Junior to change voices on Discord.

So, in this section, we want to learn how to use <strong>MorphVOX on Mac</strong>. I guess that means purchasing the Pro version. However, you’ll enjoy unlimited voice-changing capabilities. So, wasting time, here are the steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Pro for macOS. This program runs on Mac OS X 10.6 or newer.

Therefore, other apps should not be used during recording because they can use computer bandwidth and cause video quality to decline. In addition, most Mac users have complained that the Photo Booth application freezes and crashes while recording a video or that it has a freezing&#x2F;lagging issue.</p><p>The program frequently freezes, even shortly after you start recording, indicating that it is not a problem caused by the video’s duration or size. Press the stop button to see the notorious “spinning wheel of death” or a Beach Ball symbol when you finish recording. As many users have experienced, you may encounter the following issues with Photo Booth.</p><ul><li>While capturing videos, Photo Booth freezes every 30 seconds.</li><li>The video recording in the Photo Booth is sluggish.</li><li>After capturing a picture, the Photo Booth freezes, and no picture appears.</li><li>The video and audio in the Photo Booth recording are out of sync.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing"><a href="#How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing" class="headerlink" title="How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?"></a>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</h2><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum. After you’ve closed all other programs, try recording.</li><li>Before recording a video, restart your Mac to ensure that you are not being interrupted by numerous user accounts or the apps&#x2F;widgets they are using.</li><li>Check to determine if your computer’s startup disc has adequate free space. To check available free space on your Mac, go to the Finder &gt; File &gt; Get Info menu command. You can free up disc space by moving files to another drive and deleting files from the startup disc that you no longer require.</li><li>After moving the photos and videos from the Photo Booth application to a different directory, restart the software.</li><li>Select Get Info and check the option Open in 32-bit mode by right-clicking or Control + clicking on Photo Booth in the programs folder.</li><li>Your system software could also be the source of these symptoms.</li><li>Update the system software to the most recent version.</li><li>NVRAM &#x2F; PRAM should be reset.</li><li>To see if you have read and written permissions on Photo Booth in the programs folder, right-click or Control + Click on it and pick Get Info. Give yourself permission to read and write if you haven’t before.</li><li>If your Photo Booth still stalls and crashes after trying all of the above methods, reinstall OS X.</li><li>When you record a video with the camera, be sure it works in iMovie (from the camera icon somewhere down the left-hand side). If the problem persists in iMovie, it indicates a problem with the camera hardware, necessitating the return of the Mac to Apple.</li><li>If iMovie works fine, try removing the Photo Booth preferences: &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Preferences&#x2F;com.apple. In addition, PhotoBooth.plist should be deleted.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer"><a href="#Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?"></a>Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is the greatest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>You’ll discover some professional tools to help you improve video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort with the Filmora video editor. This tool is one of the most dependable, aside from the features that allow you to modify video rotation easily.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the video file</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-1.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Organize the media</strong></p><p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the files you import into the editor. However, when searching for the video clips, you want to add to the timeline, working with many different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. To reduce clutter and confusion, use the My Album feature, which allows you to create folders and organize your files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-2.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>To create and name a new folder, click the Add a New Folder icon in the top right corner of the editor’s screen, situated at the bottom of the My Project page. You can sort the footage alphabetically or any other way that improves your efficiency and reduces the time you spend looking through files.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Effects</strong></p><p>You may now disconnect the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or utilize one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-3.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>If you want to add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to a video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software comes with various text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the template you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-4.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>Next to the Text&#x2F;Credit symbol, you’ll find the Transitions icon in the editor’s toolbar, which gives you access to hundreds of settings. Learn more about video transitions and how to apply them in Filmora by watching this video tutorial.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Export and Share</strong></p><p>When you’re certain there’s nothing else you want to change or add to your project, click the Export button. You can quickly select the video file format in the Format menu in the Output window and optimize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p><p>Select the file type that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format tab, gives the video a title, and choose the folder on your hard drive where the video will be exported. Next, you can select the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-5.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</p><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unlocking-Success-in-the-World-of-Digital-Marketing"><a href="#Unlocking-Success-in-the-World-of-Digital-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking Success in the World of Digital Marketing"></a>Unlocking Success in the World of Digital Marketing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-1.jpg"                      alt="introduction"                ></p><p>Within the world of social media marketing, there are many different strategies. All of these options can make it easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>But don’t worry! We’ve got some tried-and-true tips that can help you get started on your SMM journey.</p><h2 id="What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM"><a href="#What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM" class="headerlink" title="What is social media marketing (SMM)?"></a>What is social media marketing (SMM)?</h2><p>Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.</p><p>Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.</p><p>So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.</p><p><strong>1. Design Your Strategies</strong></p><p>You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.</p><p>After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it’s consistent!</p><p>Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values&#x2F;beliefs&#x2F;needs&#x2F;desires (whatever they may be).</p><p>Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).</p><p><strong>2. Starting Live Broadcast</strong></p><p>Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.</p><p>If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.</p><p>What You’ll Need:</p><ul><li>A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.</li><li>When using a laptop, ensure there’s no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what’s happening on screen when watching via computer&#x2F;laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).</li></ul><p><strong>3. Social Media Influencer</strong></p><p>Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p><p>Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.</p><p>Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts&#x2F;content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-2.jpg"                      alt="social media influencer"                ></p><p><strong>4. Create Subscription Options</strong></p><p>Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.</p><p>To create a subscription option:</p><ul><li>Navigate to “Customize” on the top right corner of your page and select “Subscription Options” from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Enter your desired name and description, then click “Save Changes” at the bottom of this section</li><li>To set up a subscription:</li></ul><p><strong>5. Engage with your Audience</strong></p><p>Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:</p><ul><li>Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they’re being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.</li><li>Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.</li><li>Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!</li></ul><p><strong>6. Create User Generated Content</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember that social media is about the community, so it’s important to encourage your audience members to create content.</p><p>If you’re not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you’re losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:</p><ul><li>Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.</li><li>If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Create a Positive Brand Image</strong></p><p>Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.</p><p>Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website’s design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-3.jpg"                      alt="create a positive brand image"                ></p><p>It’s a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there’s no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.</p><p><strong>8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand</strong></p><p>The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.</p><p>Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.</p><p><strong>9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends</strong></p><p>Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.</p><p><strong>10. Participate in Social Media Events</strong></p><p>Social media events can be a great way to get your name out there and promote your brand.</p><ul><li>They are a good way to get new leads.</li><li>You can also use social media events to build your brand’s reputation.</li></ul><h2 id="BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message"><a href="#BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message" class="headerlink" title="BONUS: Just keep sending out a message"></a>BONUS: Just keep sending out a message</h2><p>One of the most important things to remember is that consistency is the key. You need to be constantly promoting yourself, not just every so often. Don’t just post a message once and assume that people will see it and buy from you because they won’t!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-4.jpg"                      alt="bonus just keep sending out message"                ></p><p>It should be easy for people to find you on social media if they want to buy your products or services. You have to keep sending out messages and posting updates until they do!</p><p>Social media can be hard work sometimes but don’t give up hope; if you keep trying, it will eventually pay off!</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, there you have it, our top tips for succeeding in social media marketing.</p><p>We hope this post has given you some ideas of how to get started with your SMM strategy and that it has given you some valuable insights into what makes a successful one.</p><p><a class="link"

While the M1 laptop is excellent for office use, it is even better for video editing. The video editing process is smooth due to its graphic card and faster processor. Due to the seamless sharing of unified memory across the system, applications perform better due to power efficiency. However, the problem here is that Apple’s M1 chip does not support some video editors. You may find installing a video editor on Mac M1 problematic if they lack compatibility with Apple’s innovations. Don’t worry because we have got you covered. With intense research, we managed to find video editing apps with incredible performance. Want to know the best part?

Finally, in 2020, they launched an in-house M1 chip for MacBook. The M1 chip increases the CPU efficiency 3.5 times and fastens GPU performance six times than before. With incredible graphic performance, video editing becomes faster and easier than ever.</p><p>Want to know the best part: The Apple M1 chip has incredible machine learning ability. Its efficiency is improved by 15%. For all workaholics, the M1 chip MacBook is an excellent investment as its battery life is unbeatable. Apple engraved a T2 chip within the device to make it more secure, and the SSD performance is much faster.

Surely, playing PUBG on your mobile is fun and it is also more simple, but there is a limit that you can’t do on your mobile. When you are gaming, the flexibility of the keyboard and mouse are the best things ever. Then, can you play PUBG mobile on your PC or laptop?</p><p>In this part, I will let you know how you play PUBG on a PC and how to connect with a PC voice changer. Tencent just launched its official PUBG Mobile emulator which enables you to play it even on a PC or a laptop. For those who want to have flexibility without limitation, you better watch the steps on how you play PUBG mobile on your PC below:</p><p>Step1 Download and install the Tencent Gaming Buddy emulator</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-6.jpg"                      alt="click download"                ></p><p>Download Tencent Buddy Emulator, then run the software and it will download the required files automatically. It takes about 10-15 minutes to install it.</p><p>Step2 Download the additional files</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-7.jpg"                      alt="download additional files"                ></p><p>When the emulator is installed, launch the game. It will download some necessary files required to launch the game. Make sure you have good internet connectivity since these files are large.</p><p>Step3 Get your chicken dinner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-8.jpg"                      alt="you are done"                ></p><p>When finish downloading all the additional files, log in with your credentials to import all your mobile PUBG stats. All the controls are in a tab towards the right side of the screen, enter full-screen mode by pressing F11. Since PUBG servers detect emulators, you and your friends will only be paired with other players running this emulator.</p><p>Then, you may ask, “How do I connect with a PC voice changer?” No worries, I will let you know too. For your information, free voice changers are much easier to find on PC. There are some good voice changers for PUBG such as Clownfish, Voicemod, and MorphVOX. I will give you the steps to connect with Clownfish in PUBG:</p><p>Step1 Download and launch Clownfish</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-9.jpg"                      alt="set voice changer"                ></p><p>Download the software, then launch it. After that select “Set Voice Changer” and select any desired sound effects.</p><p>Step2 Click on “Hear Microphone”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-10.jpg"                      alt="hear the voice effects"                ></p><p>Click on “Hear Microphone” and hear the voice effects. Turn that off when you have chosen your favorite effect and you are done.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone"><a href="#Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone"></a>Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone</h2><p>After you know the voice changer on your phone and your PC for PUBG, what is another alternative you can do to change your voice in PUBG? Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it’s really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?</h2><p>Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora?
