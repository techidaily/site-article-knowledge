    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Talk-to-Technology-Without-Spending-Money"><a href="#Talk-to-Technology-Without-Spending-Money" class="headerlink" title="Talk to Technology Without Spending Money"></a>Talk to Technology Without Spending Money</h2><p>It’s an obvious fact that <strong>speech recognition</strong> has been available for decades. But it was only until the emergence of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) technologies that this invention burst into life. Today, most smartphones and computers come baked with <strong>automatic speech recognition</strong> services. So, what exactly is voice recognition, and how can you exploit it on your smartphone or desktop? This article answers these questions. You’ll also learn how to use the best free voice recognition programs. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Speech-Recognition"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Speech-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Speech Recognition?"></a>Part 1: What is Speech Recognition?</h2><p>Computers and smartphones are catching up with human intelligence. Today, you can command your computer, smartphone, or smart speaker. Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon Alexa are good examples of how far speech recognition has come. Just give a command, and the voice assistant will be at your service.</p><p>But this article will dive a little deeper than the obvious. Instead of dwelling on voice assistants, we’ll discuss how you can use an automated STT program to convert audio to text. The speech recognition technology has matured enough to allow users to enjoy 99% transcription accuracy. Also, these speech-to-text transcription programs support hundreds of languages, making them perfect for bloggers, teachers, doctors, and other professions.</p><p>But take note that the ability and complexity of these programs may vary. While some are beginner-friendly, others, like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, can be a little intimidating to beginners. Also, some TTS programs like Google Speech Recognition don’t need PC downloads, saving you time. So, it depends on your preferences and skills.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Free-Speech-Recognition-Services-in-2022"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Free-Speech-Recognition-Services-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Free Speech Recognition Services in 2022"></a>Part 2: Best Free Speech Recognition Services in 2022</h2><p>We understand that professional speech-to-text services can cost a few hundreds of dollars. Therefore, we’ve dug deep to bring you these four free and highly accurate speech recognition services. Make a pick!</p><ol><li><strong>Google speech recognition</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-1.jpg"                      alt="google docs speech recognition"                ></p><p>Founded in September 1998, Google has come a long way to be one of the biggest tech companies. The company features multiple transcription services, including <a class="link"   href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=ar&tl=en&op=translate&hl=en" >Google Translate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which translates audio, documents, and texts between various languages. It supports 133 languages and is free to use on your mobile or PC browser. Just click the microphone icon on Google Translate and begin translating words.</p><p>Besides translation, use <a class="link"   href="https://cloud.google.com/" >Google Cloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to transcribe video, audio, or voice to increase your audience reach. Users can add accurate captions and subtitles to their content in real-time, thanks to ML technology similar to what Google uses to generate YouTube subtitles. It’s tailored for the Global user base as it supports 125+ languages. Google Cloud also allows you to boost transcription accuracy by providing domain-specific words or keywords.</p><p>As for the pricing, Google Cloud gives you up to $300 credits to spend over three months with the free tier. After exhausting the free minutes, you can transcribe 15-second audio for just $0.006. Now that should be affordable for all average Joes out there.</p><p>If Google Cloud doesn’t impress you, transcribe audio for free with <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" >Google Docs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s an online service allowing you to dictate texts from the built-in microphone. To do that, start a new document, click “Tools,” and then tap “Voice typing.” Now dictate unlimited texts before editing them accordingly. Remember, Google Docs supports collaborative editing.</p><ol><li><strong>Microsoft speech recognition</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-2.jpg"                      alt="windows speech recognition"                ></p><p>Like Google, Microsoft has a collection of speech recognition services too. First, you can use the built-in speech recognition service on your Windows 10&#x2F;11 computer. It’s a free service that gives you essential assistant and command capabilities. Please note that this is different from Cortana’s voice assistant.</p><p>To use Windows speech-to-text service, start by opening the program into which you want to dictate texts. This can be your browser, text editor, and so on. Then, click the Win + H shortcut before clicking the microphone icon to start dictating texts.</p><p>Alternatively, use the super-accurate <a class="link"   href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/" >Microsoft Azure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> speech-to-text service. This professional feature lets you create texts from a host of audio sources. It provides real-time audio transcription, thanks to the deep ML and AI networks that work in sync to support multiple audio sources concurrently. However, setting it up is a different ballgame altogether.</p><p>If Azure Speech to Text is too complicated for you, use OneNote to dictate texts while signed into Microsoft 365. This voice recognition software can dictate texts with punctuations, emojis, periods, symbols, currencies, and more. Also, you can edit texts by merely uttering words like delete, undo, backspace, etc.</p><ol><li><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora 11</strong></a></li></ol><p>Wondershare Filmora 11 is a powerful video editor for macOS and Windows systems. It packs many powerful features, including the AI-driven speech-to-text and text-to-speech converters. Here, you can transcribe audio or video in various languages before editing and extracting the text to a .srt file. So yes, it’s a fast and accurate subtitle generator for desktops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-3.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition create project"                ></p><p>To generate subtitles with Filmora 11, run the program on your desktop and create a New Project. After that, click the Import button to browse and load a video or audio from your local storage. Of course, you can drag and drop the media file to save time. Either way, move the uploaded file to the storyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition set language"                ></p><p>Next up, right-click the video and choose Detach Audio. In other words, you’ll be separating audio from the video clip. After that, select the audio track on the timeline and click the Speech-to-Text icon to choose the transcription language. You can transcribe the audio in English, French, German, Italian, and other languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-5.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition edit texts"                ></p><p>Now tap “Ok” to encode audio to subtitle texts. If the process is successful, double-tap the text track on the timeline to view and edit the subtitle tracks. You can change the text, layout, size, color, and more. Lastly, export the texts to an SRT file and use it on any video. It’s that quick and easy!</p><ol><li><strong>Amazon Transcribe</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-6.jpg"                      alt="amazon speech recognition"                ></p><p>Have you ever heard of AWS? Well, it is a comprehensive cloud platform with more than 200 services. AWS uses Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, making it easier, faster, and more cost-friendly. Even better, AWS has up to 98 security standard certifications, making it one of the safest cloud platforms to create and edit content.</p><p>That said, use the <a class="link"   href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/" >Amazon Transcribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature to convert audio and voices into editable texts automatically. This service lets you extract critical insights from voice calls, videos, conversations, microphone narrations; you name them. It also uses deep ML to add formatting and punctuations to your text during dictation.</p><p>AWS Transcribe also includes a few extras that you might find helpful. For example, it supports batch processing from numerous audio sources. Also, it can identify different speakers and vocabulary filtering, giving you the much-needed consistency. Plus, you can add specific vocabulary and keywords to enhance content accuracy.</p><p>Cost-wise, you’ll enjoy up to 60 minutes of free transcription services with an AWS free tier account. After depleting the credits, you can pay for the standard pay-as-you-go rates. All in all, it’s an excellent speech recognition service, although it can be an overkill for personal use.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Speech-Recognition-FAQs"><a href="#Part-3-Speech-Recognition-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Speech Recognition FAQs"></a>Part 3: Speech Recognition FAQs</h2><p>Do you have a lot of unanswered questions about voice recognition? Here are some answers to the most common speech recognition FAQs.</p><h3 id="1-Is-dictating-texts-faster-than-typing-texts"><a href="#1-Is-dictating-texts-faster-than-typing-texts" class="headerlink" title="1. Is dictating texts faster than typing texts?"></a>1. Is dictating texts faster than typing texts?</h3><p>It depends! For people without quick typing skills, dictating audio is a no-brainer. TTS programs such as Windows Speech Recognition and Google Docs allow you to dictate texts directly into the document file before editing where necessary. However, it takes a lot of discipline and clarity to dictate texts accurately.</p><h3 id="2-How-can-I-improve-the-accuracy-of-speech-recognition"><a href="#2-How-can-I-improve-the-accuracy-of-speech-recognition" class="headerlink" title="2. How can I improve the accuracy of speech recognition?"></a>2. How can I improve the accuracy of speech recognition?</h3><p>First of all, some speech recognition services are more accurate than others. But the overall text accuracy will depend on the clarity of your voice. While the built-in mic will do fine, investing in a noise-canceling voice input device is better. You should also dictate texts with longer phrases more often. And another thing, avoid using slang and abbreviations.</p><h3 id="3-Is-voice-recognition-technology-accurate"><a href="#3-Is-voice-recognition-technology-accurate" class="headerlink" title="3. Is voice recognition technology accurate?"></a>3. Is voice recognition technology accurate?</h3><p>Yes, all the voice recognition services discussed above are very accurate. But as said before, this depends on a lot of factors. Also, it’s paramount to preview your transcription work and add the necessary corrections. Remember, human intelligence is always superior.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Now you know how speech recognition can be helpful in your documentation work. If you want something free and highly effective, I recommend Google Docs or Windows Speech Recognition to dictate texts on your document app. On the other hand, use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to auto-generate subtitles from any audio or video file. But if you’re a techie, nothing stops you from using Microsoft Azure or Amazon Transcription.

If you are a small business owner or a content creator, you can use TikTok to increase your reach and earnings.</p><p>Although you can’t directly add all your website and page links to TikTok, services like Linktree make it possible.

However, most of them don’t allow you to add multiple links in your bio. It becomes problematic if you want to add links to your other social media accounts, stores, and web pages besides your official website. To solve this issue, <a class="link"   href="https://linktr.ee/" >Linktree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was created in 2016.</p><p>It is a freemium service that allows you to create a landing page with all your important links in one place.

In October 2022, TikTok and Linktree announced a new collaboration to enhance the user experience by working on a new feature called “Profile Kit.” Part of the TikTok for Developers Program, it also includes SDK Login Kit, which allows users to log in through their TikTok credentials.</p><p>After Profile Kit integration, the TikTok creators will have a more enhanced and engaging user experience on Linktree. Users can now log in to their TikTok through Linktree and display up to 6 of their videos to enhance their profile. People viewing the TikTok creator’s profile on Linktree can play those videos without leaving the platform.</p><h3 id="Premium-Services-Offered-by-Linktree"><a href="#Premium-Services-Offered-by-Linktree" class="headerlink" title="Premium Services Offered by Linktree"></a>Premium Services Offered by Linktree</h3><p>The Linktree platform was built to help users fully utilize their social media accounts to increase their reach.

If you are so excited about updating your software but you are not sure how to get started, you have come to the right page. Here are the biggest tips and tricks that you can use to enjoy the hidden features brought to you by Windows 10:</p><h4 id="1-Personalize-the-Start-Menu"><a href="#1-Personalize-the-Start-Menu" class="headerlink" title="1. Personalize the Start Menu"></a>1. Personalize the Start Menu</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>The start menu of Windows 10 is now resizable. It can be quote odd for many but it is really surprising to know that with Windows 10, you can now customize the start menu and change its size to the extent you want. You now have the option to make it taller or wider as you like. If you wish to have the start menu taking up the whole left portion of the screen of your laptop or you want a thin strip transversely the taskbar, well that is now possible with Windows 10. The taskbar is also resizable and that means you have the ability to some weird and pretty cool stuff with your device. You will surely find that having a resizable Start Menu is cool.</p><h4 id="2-Using-Cortana-in-Windows-10"><a href="#2-Using-Cortana-in-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="2. Using Cortana in Windows 10"></a>2. Using Cortana in Windows 10</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is finally here in Windows 10, taking control of the search functions as well as dishing out as much sass of the operating system in the same way with Windows Phone edition. On the other hand, by default, it will never listen and follow your commands.</p><p>If you would like to have the ability to simply bark commands at your personal computer, you launch Cortana through hitting the search field within the taskbar and then choose the Notebook icon in the left side choices pane. You choose “settings” from the list and have the “Let Cortana respond when you say ‘Hey Cortana’” choice. You will have an active and working microphone for it to work.</p><p>While you are poking around the Cortana’s options, you may dive in the Notebook menu so you can fine-tune exactly what data the digital assistant of Microsoft can open. On the other hand, you should bear in mind that like Google, the effectiveness of Cortana is related directly to how much it knows regarding you.</p><h4 id="3-Additional-Apps-you-should-try"><a href="#3-Additional-Apps-you-should-try" class="headerlink" title="3. Additional Apps you should try"></a>3.

Though they are good apps to use when you want to get started in using Windows 10, Microsoft is likewise making available the preview of touch-friendly editions of Microsoft Word, Excel as well as the PowerPoint. All of these are known to be universal apps and that means similar code is running on the phones, PCs and tablets.</p><p>On the other hand, Microsoft did not release similar apps that are optimized for tablets and phones as of now. These apps don’t come with Windows 10 yet you may download the new apps through the Store. Microsoft will also release the Music Preview and also the Video Preview applications. These apps are designed to replace the present Video and Music apps in Windows 8.1. These two will be introducing a brand new look which complements the design that Microsoft tries to implement across different apps all over the OS.</p><h4 id="4-New-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#4-New-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="4.

The New window-snapping choices allow you not just to fill partially the screen on one side but also the screen quadrant. Also, you may tap the Windows key downward and hit “Right Arrow” and the “Up Arrow”. With that, the program window would move to the top quadrant at the right side of the screen.</p><p>Windows Key-Tab open and leaves open the new task view to show all the running and working programs as well as the virtual desktops. To make the latest virtual desktop, you can use the Windows Key-Ctrl-D. Windows Key-C will get Cortana listening and following your voice input then the Windows Key-S will open its daily glance to showcase the weather, news and sports. Command the line users to obtain a bunch of new selection shortcuts by using the keys Shift and the Arrow keys.</p><h4 id="5-Using-Virtual-Desktop-Feature"><a href="#5-Using-Virtual-Desktop-Feature" class="headerlink" title="5.

You could move programs between a virtual desktop &amp; another. To make it happen, when you are running different desktops, you proceed to Task View through pressing the Windows Key-Tab combo. You right click the app you want to transfer from a virtual desktop to the other, choose “Move To” and then you move the app to the desktop where it should go.</p><p>With Windows 10, it is now easy to create several desktops as well as run applications from each, so every desktop is showing only those apps that are running in a particular virtual desktop. In case that you do not want to make use of this feature, you may simply remove the “Task View” button.</p><h4 id="6-New-Mail-App"><a href="#6-New-Mail-App" class="headerlink" title="6.

They also hate the sluggish performance of the previous versions.

[Animated] My No No No Day by Rebecca Patterson (38,488,808 views)</h3><p>The animated story <strong><em>My No No No Day</em></strong> by Rebecca Patterson tells the tale of Bella, a little child, and her “no no no” day. It addresses feelings, connections, and obligations to other people. Muted and pastel colors are used in the vibrant and intricate artwork, which makes the stocky brunette Bella stand out in her red dress and sandals.</p><p>In particular, Patterson is skilled at capturing Bella’s emotional condition through her dramatic stance as she raises her hands in disobedience, clenches her fists in annoyance, or falls to the ground in a rage. At the same time, her eyes squint sulkily, and her mouth is open constantly in loud verbal protest.</p><p><strong>Featured Review</strong></p><p><strong><em>“I think everybody has No No No days, and I love that this little girl realized she had been onery, apologized, and the mom freely forgave her!

Good bedtime story videos will relax your child, aid in their wind-down, and help them get ready for bed. They calm racing thoughts and aid in acclimatizing young bodies and brains to a peaceful night.</p><h3 id="Essential-Elements-of-An-Effective-Bedtime-Story-Video"><a href="#Essential-Elements-of-An-Effective-Bedtime-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Essential Elements of An Effective Bedtime Story Video"></a>Essential Elements of An Effective Bedtime Story Video</h3><p>Here are the elements of an effective bedtime story video.</p><p><strong>1. Plot</strong></p><p>One of the story’s most essential aspects is the plot. It propels the story’s action and aids in presenting the events’ logical progression as you guide your central character toward the intended happy ending or catastrophic finish. A simple plot’s structure is its core. Even a short story can have a beginning, middle, and end that are all delineated. A more complex plot, however, will contain a few extra pieces.</p><ul><li><strong>Exposition</strong></li></ul><p>The exposition sets the scene for the conflict or narrative driver at the story’s start by introducing the cast of characters.</p><ul><li><strong>Rising Action</strong></li></ul><p>A struggle that sets the setting for the plot to unfold will be created early on by a sequence of events and an igniting occurrence.</p><ul><li><strong>Climax</strong></li></ul><p>The part of the narrative where the tension is raised frequently caps off at the turning point.</p><ul><li><strong>Falling action</strong></li></ul><p>The subplots are resolved here as the drama advances from its thrilling finale to its resolution and conclusion.</p><ul><li><strong>Denouement</strong></li></ul><p>The part of the story where everything is resolved and all loose ends are tied.</p><p><strong>2. Music</strong></p><p>The soporific effects of watching bedtime stories set to music in three-act patterns are enhanced. In their dreams, people often have three acts. These structures frequently need more apparent segmentation and boundary lines. The idea of a beginning, middle, and the ending is helped by adding music. Music alters how bedtime story videos are communicated to the audience’s brains. It intensifies the feeling and can be utilized to highlight the three-act framework even though it is not overtly included in the plot. Imagine having a dream that is structured like a three-act play. It is the ideal sleeping pattern.</p><h3 id="DIY-Your-Own-Heart-warming-Bedtime-Stories-for-Your-Kids"><a href="#DIY-Your-Own-Heart-warming-Bedtime-Stories-for-Your-Kids" class="headerlink" title="DIY Your Own Heart-warming Bedtime Stories for Your Kids"></a>DIY Your Own Heart-warming Bedtime Stories for Your Kids</h3><p>The availability of applications like Filmora makes employing them to produce bedtime story videos a clear advantage.

Good bedtime story videos will relax your child, aid in their wind-down, and help them get ready for bed.

Plot</strong></p><p>One of the story’s most essential aspects is the plot. It propels the story’s action and aids in presenting the events’ logical progression as you guide your central character toward the intended happy ending or catastrophic finish. A simple plot’s structure is its core. Even a short story can have a beginning, middle, and end that are all delineated. A more complex plot, however, will contain a few extra pieces.</p><ul><li><strong>Exposition</strong></li></ul><p>The exposition sets the scene for the conflict or narrative driver at the story’s start by introducing the cast of characters.</p><ul><li><strong>Rising Action</strong></li></ul><p>A struggle that sets the setting for the plot to unfold will be created early on by a sequence of events and an igniting occurrence.</p><ul><li><strong>Climax</strong></li></ul><p>The part of the narrative where the tension is raised frequently caps off at the turning point.</p><ul><li><strong>Falling action</strong></li></ul><p>The subplots are resolved here as the drama advances from its thrilling finale to its resolution and conclusion.</p><ul><li><strong>Denouement</strong></li></ul><p>The part of the story where everything is resolved and all loose ends are tied.</p><p><strong>2. Music</strong></p><p>The soporific effects of watching bedtime stories set to music in three-act patterns are enhanced. In their dreams, people often have three acts. These structures frequently need more apparent segmentation and boundary lines. The idea of a beginning, middle, and the ending is helped by adding music. Music alters how bedtime story videos are communicated to the audience’s brains. It intensifies the feeling and can be utilized to highlight the three-act framework even though it is not overtly included in the plot. Imagine having a dream that is structured like a three-act play. It is the ideal sleeping pattern.</p><h3 id="DIY-Your-Own-Heart-warming-Bedtime-Stories-for-Your-Kids-1"><a href="#DIY-Your-Own-Heart-warming-Bedtime-Stories-for-Your-Kids-1" class="headerlink" title="DIY Your Own Heart-warming Bedtime Stories for Your Kids"></a>DIY Your Own Heart-warming Bedtime Stories for Your Kids</h3><p>The availability of applications like Filmora makes employing them to produce bedtime story videos a clear advantage.

Past experiments have shown that the age group from 2-12 suffers from the sickness and it reportedly decreases till the age of 21. The cycle then starts again in the late 50’s. We are now in a dire need of ways to get rid of the sickness in order to fully experience the VR systems and make them user friendly. According to Popular Science, VR sickness and general VR discomfort are currently among the biggest hurdles to overcome before VR is comfortably adopted by the mass market. Scientists have set their goals upon making the VR system a true hit towards the end of this year. The highlights say that the scientists have found ways to eliminate virtual reality sickness, making 2017 to be ‘the year of Virtual Reality’. Until then we can adopt some careful set of rules to avoid that nauseous feeling during the game.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Lock your eyes:</strong> When we move around in real life, our eyes do not run in parallel with our body. So the same should happen inside the virtual environment. Locking your eyes at a fixed point while turning in a game can avoid the issue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chew a gum:</strong> To stay in a virtual environment for long, a chewing gum might just help. The repetitive jaw movement can help you tackle some of the effects of virtual reality sickness.</p></li><li><p>**Take a break:**You need to remind your brain that you are not actually moving. Take a break when you are experiencing virtual reality. Stare at the wall or some stationary point. Time to time breaks can put your brain to ease.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep breaths:</strong> No matter how exciting the game is, do not let your body and brain drift along excitement. Control your breathing in order to control the influence of virtual reality sickness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lower the brightness.</strong>  Some users say that lowering the brightness can help you reduce the sickness level. Some games have brightness adjuster that you can use to your choice.</p></li><li><p>**Do not to move your head a lot.**Since motion sickness is connected to movement, reducing your head movement left and right and up and down in one place can help you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid moving backwards and strafing.</strong>  If it’s a fast paced game that you are playing it is quite usual for you to want to use strafing to avoid bullets hitting you.</p></li><li><p>**Properly adjust the head gear.**Make sure your head gear fits you perfectly so there isn’t any calibration problem.</p></li></ol><h2 id="What-is-Virtual-reality-sickness"><a href="#What-is-Virtual-reality-sickness" class="headerlink" title="What is Virtual reality sickness?"></a>What is Virtual reality sickness?</h2><p> All we know about the reality of the real world around us is that it comes from the perception of our sensory organs and their co-relation with the sense-managing system of our brain to generate useful information. Thus if we present our sensory system with the kind of information that really isn’t there our brain would begin to explore it and comprehend it as reality to us. Such a type of self-made information and the resulting outcome is what we call ‘virtual reality’.</p><p> You can definitely not deny all the fun you can have with this new technology once you grab on all the cool gadgets and gears. Putting on a virtual reality headset can take you to a completely different world but would it really be fun when you have to vomit after ten minutes? Virtual reality sickness is a big hurdle to the widespread use of the virtual reality technology. The fact that ‘with virtual reality comes the sickness’ has been a major worry factor to the developers and scientists. Virtual Reality sickness brings along symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, discomfort, sweating, drowsiness, disorientation and apathy. Virtual reality sickness, however, is not a new problem. It has been known since the test pilots, test drivers and astronauts have been practicing their skills in simulators and mock vehicles.</p><h2 id="Why-virtual-reality-make-people-sickness"><a href="#Why-virtual-reality-make-people-sickness" class="headerlink" title="Why virtual reality make people sickness"></a>Why virtual reality make people sickness</h2><p> Now the question arises, what is really making us sick? Is it the gadgets or gears? Or some manufacturing flaw? The link connecting virtual reality and the sickness, lies within the human body itself. When you are in a virtual environment, in some cases, your body’s sense of balance does not completely line up with the movements of your head. Also, when the environment around you moves, but your body stays stationary you experience dizziness or nausea. Typically, the bigger the mismatch the worse the sickness. According to the statement delivered by a military pilot, when you go inside a simulator, the movements don’t exactly match the same as they do in the real world, and all of a sudden, what you feel is just not right. Another reason causing the problem is based on virtual reality games and other such systems. In such a VR system you experience environment larger than the room you are in. All these factors can ultimately drive you sick!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-essential-iphone-and-android-apps-to-transform-your-gopro-shots-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential iPhone & Android Apps to Transform Your GoPro Shots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-craft-crisp-composites-online-with-top-frameer-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Craft Crisp Composites Online with Top Frameer Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enhance-your-cinematic-experience-camera-upgrade-tips/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Enhance Your Cinematic Experience -

Therefore, other apps should not be used during recording because they can use computer bandwidth and cause video quality to decline. In addition, most Mac users have complained that the Photo Booth application freezes and crashes while recording a video or that it has a freezing&#x2F;lagging issue.</p><p>The program frequently freezes, even shortly after you start recording, indicating that it is not a problem caused by the video’s duration or size. Press the stop button to see the notorious “spinning wheel of death” or a Beach Ball symbol when you finish recording. As many users have experienced, you may encounter the following issues with Photo Booth.</p><ul><li>While capturing videos, Photo Booth freezes every 30 seconds.</li><li>The video recording in the Photo Booth is sluggish.</li><li>After capturing a picture, the Photo Booth freezes, and no picture appears.</li><li>The video and audio in the Photo Booth recording are out of sync.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing"><a href="#How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing" class="headerlink" title="How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?"></a>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</h2><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum. After you’ve closed all other programs, try recording.</li><li>Before recording a video, restart your Mac to ensure that you are not being interrupted by numerous user accounts or the apps&#x2F;widgets they are using.</li><li>Check to determine if your computer’s startup disc has adequate free space. To check available free space on your Mac, go to the Finder &gt; File &gt; Get Info menu command. You can free up disc space by moving files to another drive and deleting files from the startup disc that you no longer require.</li><li>After moving the photos and videos from the Photo Booth application to a different directory, restart the software.</li><li>Select Get Info and check the option Open in 32-bit mode by right-clicking or Control + clicking on Photo Booth in the programs folder.</li><li>Your system software could also be the source of these symptoms.</li><li>Update the system software to the most recent version.</li><li>NVRAM &#x2F; PRAM should be reset.</li><li>To see if you have read and written permissions on Photo Booth in the programs folder, right-click or Control + Click on it and pick Get Info. Give yourself permission to read and write if you haven’t before.</li><li>If your Photo Booth still stalls and crashes after trying all of the above methods, reinstall OS X.</li><li>When you record a video with the camera, be sure it works in iMovie (from the camera icon somewhere down the left-hand side). If the problem persists in iMovie, it indicates a problem with the camera hardware, necessitating the return of the Mac to Apple.</li><li>If iMovie works fine, try removing the Photo Booth preferences: &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Preferences&#x2F;com.apple. In addition, PhotoBooth.plist should be deleted.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer"><a href="#Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?"></a>Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is the greatest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>You’ll discover some professional tools to help you improve video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort with the Filmora video editor. This tool is one of the most dependable, aside from the features that allow you to modify video rotation easily.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the video file</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-1.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Organize the media</strong></p><p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the files you import into the editor. However, when searching for the video clips, you want to add to the timeline, working with many different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. To reduce clutter and confusion, use the My Album feature, which allows you to create folders and organize your files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-2.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>To create and name a new folder, click the Add a New Folder icon in the top right corner of the editor’s screen, situated at the bottom of the My Project page. You can sort the footage alphabetically or any other way that improves your efficiency and reduces the time you spend looking through files.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Effects</strong></p><p>You may now disconnect the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or utilize one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-3.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>If you want to add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to a video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software comes with various text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the template you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-4.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>Next to the Text&#x2F;Credit symbol, you’ll find the Transitions icon in the editor’s toolbar, which gives you access to hundreds of settings. Learn more about video transitions and how to apply them in Filmora by watching this video tutorial.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Export and Share</strong></p><p>When you’re certain there’s nothing else you want to change or add to your project, click the Export button. You can quickly select the video file format in the Format menu in the Output window and optimize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p><p>Select the file type that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format tab, gives the video a title, and choose the folder on your hard drive where the video will be exported. Next, you can select the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-5.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</p><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum.

It is entirely acoustic, with no visual elements. The dialogue, sound effects, and music help the audience understand what is going on. They shape the story by imagining the settings and characters.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Everything-about-Radio-Drama-Scripts"><a href="#Part-1-Everything-about-Radio-Drama-Scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Everything about Radio Drama Scripts"></a>Part 1. Everything about Radio Drama Scripts</h2><p>A radio play script is written in a specific format that allows the playwright to convey how sound and music will be used in the performance. For example, one page of dialogue equals about one minute of airtime. Each scene should be labeled with a number. Normally, lines are double-spaced.</p><h3 id="1-What-are-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#1-What-are-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="1. What are radio drama scripts?"></a>1. What are radio drama scripts?</h3><p>A radio drama is a presentation of a fictional work distributed on the radio. It is completely acoustic with no visual components. The audience understands what is happening through dialogue, sound effects, and music. They give form to the story by visualizing the environment and characters.</p><p>Audio dramas can be works of fiction written expressly for radio broadcasting or podcasting. Alternatively, they can be adapted from plays, novels, short stories, etc.</p><p>Now there is often a need to write audio dramas specifically for radio, as stage plays rely on what the audience can see on stage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-1.jpg"                      alt="radio drama scripts"                ></p><h3 id="2-Elements-of-radio-drama"><a href="#2-Elements-of-radio-drama" class="headerlink" title="2. Elements of radio drama"></a>2. Elements of radio drama</h3><p>Drama’s elements are its fundamental building blocks. The elements of drama are defined as the “key ingredients” of drama in the Arts in New Zealand Curriculum.</p><p>Radio drama contains the same elements as stage drama:</p><ul><li><strong>Role:</strong> characters in the game</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> when the event takes place</li><li><strong>Place:</strong> where the action takes place</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> what happens in the drama?</li><li><strong>Tension:</strong> conflict between characters and their surroundings</li><li><strong>Focus:</strong> the thoughts, feelings, or characters the playwright wants us to focus on at a particular moment.</li></ul><p>In radio drama, however, the playwright must inform us of the elements through various means, because we cannot get the information with our eyes. Radio drama is essentially heard, not seen.</p><h3 id="3-Radio-drama-features"><a href="#3-Radio-drama-features" class="headerlink" title="3. Radio drama features"></a>3. Radio drama features</h3><p><strong>The following are Radio Drama Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Radio drama uses sound to convey ideas to the audience. Audio can be in the form of dialogue, sound effects, or music.</li><li>Actors can play more than one role from moment to moment because only the voice needs to be changed.</li><li>Actors only use voice to express a character. They don’t need to use action, gestures, or facial expressions because the audience can’t see them.</li><li>There is no need for blocking or stage business in radio drama. However, actors may need to plan their movement to and from the microphone.</li><li>Radio playback can be set almost anywhere. There are no physical limits to overcome. Settings can easily be created with music and sound effects.</li><li>Radio drama contains a lot of dialogue. Since we can’t see what the actors are doing, they have to tell us what’s going on. The writer has to find ways for the characters to comment on where they are and what they and others are doing.</li><li>Radio scenes are often shorter than stage plays.</li><li>Radio drama must not be “live” in front of an audience. Radio drama is usually recorded and played back to an audience at a different time. This means that, just like in a movie, scenes don’t have to be played back-to-back and can be played more than once to get the best shot if needed. Drama can also be edited, and audio added.</li><li>Actors do not need to learn their lines. The actors can read their lines from the script because the audience can’t see it. Actors must be familiar with their lines and rehearsed how they will use their voice to tell the audience about the character and the action.</li><li>Radio drama usually features a small cast. A small number of characters are used in each scene because it is too difficult for the audience to distinguish between voices if there are many characters. The audience can also forget that a character is “on stage” if they don’t speak for a while because they can’t be seen. Because of this, the characters must speak quite often and be involved in the plot.</li><li>Radio drama is well suited for monologue and for plays where the setting is limited and physical action is not important, such as in a prison cell or cave.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts"></a>Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts</h2><p>Scriptwriting is a fundamental technique of creativity, whether for content production, copywriting, or art direction. Florida International University offers the Master of Science Creative Track in collaboration with the world-renowned portfolio school Miami Ad School. If you want to become a copywriter, the program is designed to hone your writing skills for a variety of communication styles and media, such as writing for video and audio content, TV and radio commercials, and the web.</p><p>Here are some tips to become a better audio-only content writer.</p><p>Writing a script allows you to control the content, structure, and flow of the program. If the show is unscripted and organic, the host will have talking points for reference. In addition to the script, you can also play with music and sound effects.</p><h3 id="1-Keep-your-scripts-clear"><a href="#1-Keep-your-scripts-clear" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your scripts clear"></a>1. Keep your scripts clear</h3><p>Write the script while keeping it as simple as possible. Don’t fill your sentences with words that don’t add to what you’re trying to say.</p><p>Reading from a script can make you sound a little unnatural, as well as stiff and robotic. That is a huge error. When read aloud, the script should sound natural. A more formal approach and style can result in a show that sounds unnatural and is boring.</p><p>Radio has long been a popular form of entertainment, and radio dramas or plays are an excellent way for writers to express themselves. Original stories or adaptations of novels or plays can be used in radio dramas. Radio plays, like stage plays, have scenes, sequences, and acts, but they are not always structured the same way. Radio drama allows for a great deal of flexibility and creativity, and the medium of sound is also unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-2.jpg"                      alt="keep your scripts clear"                ></p><p>Novelists and screenwriters will need to alter their writing style to write for the ear rather than the eye. Listeners cannot read the previous line or skip ahead. Everything must make sense and be visualized by the listener at that time. To convey action and drama, use dialogue, sound effects, music, and even silence. This can be completed by including specific audio cues in your script so that the show’s creators understand your vision. Keep the script as brief as possible. There can never be too much prose or long-winded dialogue in radio plays. Everything must be brief, succinct, and to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Jump-right-into-the-action"><a href="#2-Jump-right-into-the-action" class="headerlink" title="2. Jump right into the action"></a>2. Jump right into the action</h3><p>Radio drama can be more difficult because it must immediately engage listeners, or they will lose interest and switch stations or channels. The first two minutes are crucial, so start your drama at the appropriate point in the story. The rule of thumb in the radio industry is ‘arrive late, leave early.’ This means you should enter the story at a later stage when the action has begun or when a crisis has occurred. Unlike books and movies, setting, building, and background details are not required. You can save the necessary details for later in the play.</p><p>Radio scripts, like scripts, must conform to industry standards for radio program producers to find the script usable. Include scripts for music, sound effects, silence, dialogue, and other audio needs in the game so that producers can see how the script will translate into the show. Include information for the actors as well, so they can bring your vision to life. For example, use adjectives to describe how they should sound when reading their lines - sad, angry, laughing, and so on. Also, keep the number of characters to a minimum and give each one a distinct voice and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-3.jpg"                      alt="jump right into the action"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational"><a href="#3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational" class="headerlink" title="3. Make It Sound Conversational"></a>3. Make It Sound Conversational</h3><p>Whether fully scripted or not, audio programs are at their best when they sound natural. Make sure your grammar is concise and to the point so that you can improvise and expand on what you’ve written.</p><p>Write like you talk. A well-written script, read word for word, should be invisible to the listener. Your script must sound natural and relaxed. Read the script out loud or have someone read it.</p><p>Can’t find people ready to help? No problem, paste the script into your text-to-speech program. Wondershare Filmora has a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >text-to-speech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>(TTS) feature. If you’re gasping in the middle of a sentence, shorten your sentences.</p><p>If the words are too difficult to express well or the meaning might be lost on the listener, try to use simple words whenever possible. Also, use free online tools like Hemingway Editor to help you identify complex sentences.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Some-famous-radio-dramas"><a href="#Part-3-Some-famous-radio-dramas" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

With an increased desirability for virtual reality systems, interactive videos and more, everyone is having to upgrade their equipment to create and access 360° content.</p><p>There are a number of big reasons to buy 360° cameras and some top considerations to keep in mind for any type of 360° camera that you end up picking. Some of the top reasons why many people are turning to 360° cameras include:</p><ul><li><strong>The inclusion of VR tech:</strong> more users around the world are adopting VR Tech than ever before. With VR tech that is used with cell phones and widespread VR devices like the PlayStation VR and oculus rift, there is a greater demand for this type of content.</li><li><strong>Introducing it with video hosting:</strong> many video hosting sites are also including 360° camera technology. This means that users can shoot and edit 360 degree films and post them online for a number of video hosting sites like YouTube.</li><li><strong>Capturing more:</strong> Users are interested in immersive experiences and with 360° VR cameras it becomes possible to really capture a scene and use more parts of that scene. With a capture device that can capture more than just the 180° of film, a filmmaker can have more to work with.</li><li><strong>The future of film:</strong> 360° cameras represent the latest in film technology and with more filmmakers using these styles of cameras, we are seeing new and inspiring cinematic works. Many Hollywood directors are now using these high-quality cameras in their filmmaking projects and producing more immersive films than ever before.</li></ul><h2 id="Thing-you-need-to-consider-when-buying-a-360-camera"><a href="#Thing-you-need-to-consider-when-buying-a-360-camera" class="headerlink" title="Thing you need to consider when buying a 360 camera"></a>Thing you need to consider when buying a 360 camera</h2><p>The big barrier to entry with 360° angle cameras is that they are still relatively new pieces of technology. If you are a filmmaker that’s interested in picking up a brand-new camera, you may expect to pay anywhere between a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. Most 360° cameras today retail for thousands of dollars up front because the technology or the camera rigs require the use of so many lenses, solutions for stitching and more. As a result of this higher cost to use these cameras, it’s a very good idea to go into the purchase well informed.</p><p><strong>1. The two main types of video cameras:</strong></p><p><strong>Monoscopic:</strong> Monoscopic 360° video cameras are the most commonly used for VR content. This type of content usually involves the use of filming the video with one camera and then stitching together the field of view of several cameras on a rig to create the full image. The most common set up for this style of video usually involves a least six different cameras in six different fields of view to create the full 360° experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-camera-buying-guide-monoscopic.jpg"                      alt="360 camera buying guide - Monoscopic camera"                ></p><p><strong>Stereoscopic:</strong> stereoscopic is a camera that utilizes two cameras designed for each eye. This can create a 3-D experience. You can set up a stereoscopic camera on a special rig with considerations for what each eye would see in the final stitched image. This can generate the 360° yield the vision and create a 3-D&#x2F;360° view. Stereoscopic cameras often need to decrease the resolution with the added image data required for capturing 3-D images. Usually the resolution on a stereoscopic camera is around half of what a monoscopic camera can produce and this is why monoscopic cameras remain the preferred choice for many content creators.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-camera-buying-guide-stereoscopic.jpg"                      alt="360 camera buying guide - Stereoscopic camera"                ></p><p>After determining the style of camera that you would like to use in the rig or look for with your purchase, you can build on some other considerations for a 3-D camera.</p><p><strong>2. Considerations in your purchase</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The lens:</strong> The lenses used for capture are perhaps some of the most important aspects of any camera. A 360° camera will likely have at least two lenses and it is important to look at the shutter time as well as the ISO range to see if the lens is capable of what you need for filming.</li><li><strong>Check image quality:</strong> The resolution that the camera is capable of producing is also an essential part of the process. A quality image will be determined by the number of pixels assigned in the frame. Looking for higher resolution frames, will often result in a better quality video. Remember that 3-D videos are usually half the resolution of a 2-D video camera.</li><li><strong>FPS:</strong> the frames per second available from your camera can be another big factor. While some of the best film cameras in the world can capture at 50 frames per second and above, at least 30 frames per second will be required to ensure that your camera is capable of capturing video at a rate that is similar to that of a film camera.</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> The internal storage capabilities of the camera can be a hallmark of its quality. Some of the highest quality film cameras in the world will come with internal hard drives and most accessible cameras should at the very least have an expandable SD or micro SD slot.</li><li><strong>Size of the rig&#x2F;camera:</strong> portability and convenience can be a big aspect of the camera for filmmakers. If you need a camera rig that can easily fit into a purse or bag, a large-scale camera rig that is superheavy may not be a great option for your purchase. Weighing the cost benefit of a large camera for its image quality versus a portable camera for its convenience may be a good idea.</li><li><strong>The life of the battery:</strong> because of the extra processing power that is required for multiple cameras to run and capture images from the 360° perspective, extra battery life is required for any 360° camera. Check into the battery life specifications and consider how much time you will have shooting before purchasing any camera. Saving a few dollars might be nice, but having a fully rechargeable battery that lasts for 40 minutes to an hour of shooting can be far more convenient than only getting a few minutes of shots at a time.</li></ul><h2 id="Cameras-recommended-for-each-level"><a href="#Cameras-recommended-for-each-level" class="headerlink" title="Cameras recommended for each level"></a>Cameras recommended for each level</h2><p><strong>For beginners</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Ricoh Theta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> This small and compact cameras available for just a few hundred dollars and it can be an excellent introductory camera for beginners in 360° filming.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Samsung gear 360: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> the Samsung gear 360 is an auxiliary device for Samsung galaxy phones.

Moreover, you can opt for photography as a profession and earn unlimited monetary benefits. However, photography is not limited to capturing pictures as it only includes the editing phase. There are numerous photo editors in the market to conduct photo editing, but non-professionals are not aware enough to use such tools.</p><p>This article will include some valuable tips that you can apply through a professional editor: <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canvaphotoeditor online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig into details to know more about photo editing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-10-Helpful-Tips-for-Using-Canva-Photo-Editor"><a href="#Part-1-10-Helpful-Tips-for-Using-Canva-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 10 Helpful Tips for Using Canva Photo Editor"></a>Part 1: 10 Helpful Tips for Using Canva Photo Editor</h2><p>If you have clicked a photo that does not look artistic, creative, or flawless, you can still improve the quality of your photo through exceptional photo editing. Through the peculiar features and tools of the Canva image editor, implement the following tips to enhance your images effortlessly. You should look into these!</p><h3 id="1-Remove-Background"><a href="#1-Remove-Background" class="headerlink" title="1. Remove Background"></a>1. Remove Background</h3><p>The background of your image is an integral part of the portrait as it facilitates grabbing the viewer’s attention. While capturing a picture, it is possible that there are some unnecessary objects or people in the frame. Or, in some cases, the background looks dull and ruins the whole image. Canva has introduced its background remover, through which you can quickly erase the background of your picture.</p><p>Moreover, you can design or choose pre-made background templates on this tool to add a vibrant and creative background. Thus, an eye-catchy background on your pictures can make a good impression of yours. Isn’t it great?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/canva-photo-editor-tips-1.jpg"                      alt="canva ai background remover feature"                ></p><h3 id="2-Apply-Filters-by-Quick-Search"><a href="#2-Apply-Filters-by-Quick-Search" class="headerlink" title="2. Apply Filters by Quick Search"></a>2. Apply Filters by Quick Search</h3><p>Every photo editor consists of filters and effects to make ordinary photos look attractive. Just like other photo editors, Canva photo editor also has its exclusive filters that range in various options such as summer glow, natural tint, and many more. You can adjust the intensity of filters with your fingers and can manage their brightness, saturation, contrast, and tint effects.</p><p>Other interesting effects include BadTV, through which you can add cinematic and vintage effects to your photos by exploring different options. Thus, enhance and beautify your photos with a few swipes, and you can confidently post them across social media platforms. You should try it!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/canva-photo-editor-tips-2.jpg"                      alt="search and apply filters"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-Text-to-Images"><a href="#3-Add-Text-to-Images" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Text to Images"></a>3. Add Text to Images</h3><p>Do you like to post Instagram or Facebook stories with catchy captions embedded in them? Canva photo editor online gives you huge and diverse options to add text on the images with fancy styles and colors. You can add an aligned text by adjusting it to various angles such as right, left, or center. Afterward, you can select the font, color, and style of your added text through finger swipes.</p><p>You can also manage the size of your text to make it look appropriate and suitable for your image. Hence, you can use the text images to post them as stories on social media accounts or use them for commercial purposes. This is surely good!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/canva-photo-editor-tips-3.jpg"                      alt="add texts to photos"                ></p><h3 id="4-Add-Frames-to-the-Image"><a href="#4-Add-Frames-to-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="4.

Given the way Microsoft has added powerful features to Photos, it has the capability to offer much more to users. One such feature is the option to add the effect of slow motion in Windows 10 using the Photos app. We will explain how you can use the slow motion feature in Photos, along with an option to add the effect of slow motion online.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: Customizing the Slow Motion Effect</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Edit in Slow Motion Online</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1：How-to-Use-Slow-Motion-in-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-1：How-to-Use-Slow-Motion-in-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10"></a>Part 1：How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10</h2><p>There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a video program if you need to perform some basic editing and effects on your videos.

You will go to “open with” and then choose the Photos app. When it is open in the application, you can click on “Edit &amp; Create” and then go to “Add slo-mo”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-motion-photos-app.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><p>If you do not see the option anywhere on your Photos app, there is a chance you are running an outdated version of Windows 10 on your computer.

You will be able to select the speed using a slider, which lets you get the precise slow motion effect that you desire.</p><p>There is also the handy option of being able to select the portion of your video where you want to add this effect. Say you are producing a longer video, where you want the effect in place for a few seconds.</p><p>Now you can select the beginning and end point using the bottom slider on the Photos app. Choose the precise starting and ending of the slow motion effect, and then watch through your video to ensure it is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-slow-motion-microsoft-photos.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><p>We recommend that you save your video file under a new name when you are done making your desired changes.

If you are looking for a large screen as well as some of the fastest processing power from a Samsung device, this is a premium phone that also comes with a premium price. Working to compete with Apple, the iPhone seven as well as other flagship phones is a very difficult process in the galaxy S8 isn’t perfect. It is however a dramatic shift for Samsung.</p><ul><li><a href="#section1">Section 1: Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware Design</a></li><li><a href="#section2">Section 2: Samsung Galaxy S8 Features and Performance</a></li><li><a href="#section3">Section 3: Samsung Galaxy S8 Onboard Software</a></li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y14T5YW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06Y14T5YW&linkId=01db8297751893b9921ba30138d3f180" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Pros-and-cons"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Pros-and-cons" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy S8 Pros and cons"></a>Samsung Galaxy S8 Pros and cons</h2><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>The first and most recognizable feature of this device is the large display with its bezel free design.</li><li>The S8 comes with incredible power on board as well.</li><li>The camera produces some beautiful photos even if you don’t consider yourself a photographer.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Biometric unlocking can become a tedious security feature.</li><li>One of the most expensive phones on the market</li><li>The Bixby feature is largely pointless.</li></ul><h2 id="Section-1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Hardware-Design"><a href="#Section-1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware Design"></a>Section 1: Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Design"><a href="#1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Design" class="headerlink" title="1.Samsung Galaxy S8 Design"></a>1.Samsung Galaxy S8 Design</h4><p>The body design is unlike anything you’ve ever seen on this device. The curved screen, as well as the design without bezels, is truly something to both hold. It’s probably one of the most beautiful smartphones on the market from a design perspective. This screen offers some of the sharpest clarity and color production on any natural phone.</p><p>Everything in the design of this phone is done at a premium. If you’re going be upgrading from a galaxy S5 or switching over from an older iPhone you will feel as though you’re living in the future. The glass on the front is curved on both sides rounded with a glossy style feature and this could very well become the new standard. This style of screen is extremely easy to get adjusted with as well.</p><p>The metal rim and the quality glass and weight to the phone really just make it feel like a premium device and it certainly is with a price tag sometimes in excess of $1100 US. Each of the buttons on the phone are extremely well-crafted as well. Samsung removed a number of keys and included some new keys on the phone to improve the tactile feeling and durability. The only real button that can sometimes get in the way is the Bixby information screen. This button seems to get in the way and start up the Bixby voice recognition app regularly. This is really the only detraction from the overall design and style with the power button still found on the right-hand side in good placement, volume rocker on the left-hand side as well as a fingerprint scanner in a fairly sensible area right next to the camera. USB c connections can be found in the bottom.</p><p>A standard headphone jack can still be found at the top of this device as well.</p><h4 id="2-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Display"><a href="#2-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Display" class="headerlink" title="2.Samsung Galaxy S8 Display"></a>2.Samsung Galaxy S8 Display</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-s8-design.jpg"                      alt="samsung-s8-design"                ></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a display that is known for being particularly stunning. It can deliver beautiful black and white contrast tones as well as very rich colors. Do yourself a favor and start streaming content in HD as soon as you get this device.</p><p>With a screen free of any black space the phone offers a 5.8 inch display which is one of the biggest on the market. The 18.5:9 ratio delivers a completely unique look on a smart phone especially when many applications and videos are made to fit a 16 :9 widescreen. Nevertheless Samsung handles this conversion very well and delivers wonderful entertainment experiences.</p><p>The device is certified by UHT alliance and delivers HDR compatible display. The only problem is that there currently aren’t any HDR compatible applications or videos apart from the ones that you might actually shoot on this camera.</p><h4 id="3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Hardware"><a href="#3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="3.Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware"></a>3.Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware</h4><p>The hardware on this device is equally as impressive with a Snapdragon 835 standard processor that delivers industry-leading performance. It also comes with a standard 64 GB of HD storage with the chance to expand via the SD memory card of your choice. It’s possible to extend the memory of this phone with a 256 GB card for nearly endless possibilities with filming content, downloading apps and more.</p><p>It may not have the same amount of RAM that you might find in a Oneplus 5 but with 4 GB of onboard RAM the device does fine when paired with this processor. It can run through some of the worlds most demanding applications as well as display HD content with ease.</p><p>The battery on board is kept to just a 3000mAH option which is lower than some of the other competitors but the device does have a number of power saving techniques within Android as well as the efficiency of the hardware itself.</p><p>In many stress tests with this phone even with high-rise display it can deliver improved sharpness as well as handle a large load of tasks. It is one of the best speced phones on the market and it produces some of the best benchmark results available today.</p><p>To make connectivity even better the S8 is equipped with Bluetooth five which improves range, control and even the option for improved smart home automation.</p><h4 id="4-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Durability"><a href="#4-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Durability" class="headerlink" title="4. Samsung Galaxy S8 Durability"></a>4. Samsung Galaxy S8 Durability</h4><p>The phone comes with a very durable design that is created to be waterproof. With the full certification on waterproofing this is maybe not a device that you would use for diving but it can stand up to light rain, splashing and other situations. The majority of the device is made out of an aluminum instruction with the front of the device being constructed out of Gorilla Glass 5. The weight and the durability of this device is not something to question as it can deliver the best in performance throughout a standard day.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Section-2-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Samsung Galaxy S8 Features and Performance"></a>Section 2: Samsung Galaxy S8 Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Camera-Performance"><a href="#1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Camera-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1. Samsung Galaxy S8 Camera Performance"></a>1. Samsung Galaxy S8 Camera Performance</h4><p>The camera in the Galaxy S8 hasn’t been upgraded that much since previous versions of the Galaxy. On board comes a 12 megapixel camera in the rear of the Samsung device as well as an eight megapixel sensor in the front facing camera. The device is other software have been upgraded fairly substantially and this means producing photos that have great contrast and edits done almost automatically on the phone. Although the specs have not been upgraded Samsung has really zeroed in on the right types of cameras to use in their devices.</p><p>Some of the photos that were taken in tests tend to look a little bit over exposed but overall the device handles taking photos in all types of lighting very well. Double tapping the power button will instantly open up the camera app to make for quick photos. With the onboard performance it’s also possible to capture images in less than a second. Quick shortcuts as well as an even quicker photo app ensures that you can always capture the shot even when you are pressed for time.</p><p>If you want to edit your 4K video footage on Galaxy S8, or you want to make video with the photos you shot with Galaxy S8, we recommend you to try Filmora, which will make a video for you within one minutes. It is easy to use yet powerful enough.

It actually possible the connected to different Bluetooth speakers at once using the S8 to produce a stereo sound equivalent. The onboard speaker is relatively strong but it is these Bluetooth features that really improved the sound on the phone and the type of sounds that you can get watching videos, streaming content and more.</p><p>The sound on board the phone through the music player application and the headphones that come with the device is also extremely strong. While Samsung has always produced relatively strong speakers in its smartphone considerable changes really haven’t been made with the S8 apart from the Bluetooth inclusion.</p><h4 id="3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Battery-Performance"><a href="#3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Battery-Performance" class="headerlink" title="3. Samsung Galaxy S8 Battery Performance"></a>3. Samsung Galaxy S8 Battery Performance</h4><p>With just a 3000 mAh battery on board, most would have expected to see a larger battery. Many suggest that the reason Samsung scaled back the battery is to avoid the chance for explosions and fires that occurred with the note 7. The battery life is fairly good to considering the type of hardware that’s on board. It’s the power saving modes and the efficient hardware that really make this 3000 mAh battery seem like a substantial option.</p><p>More conveniently the S8 does offer wireless charging. If you have a wireless charging platform the process for charging this phone at night or throughout the day is very simple. This extra feature really improves the versatility of this device and ensure is that you can keep it well charged up through the day.

One of the only problems that comes with using these biometrics is that you can end up with a device that consistently needs your permission to unlock and access various applications. Setting up the features is relatively easy and can be done at the start during Samsung set up. Most people end up turning off the iris recognition, facial recognition and opt for fingerprint scanning only as of the much more discreet way to unlock the phone.</p><h4 id="5-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Compatibility"><a href="#5-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="5.

Bixby is an assistant at similar to the Google Assistant, Siri and more. Currently Bixby really just delivers a number of different alerts and reminders. The one feature that is fairly interested is the Bixby vision which can examine items in a store and help you comparison shop as well as the ongoing reminders and calendar updates. The current version of Bixby is pretty light but Samsung hopes to eventually include actions like the ability for Bixby to handle uploading all of your photos to social media or even sending out texts and alerts. Currently however Bixby is a fairly light app that you won’t likely use often.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>This is currently one of the best android smart phones available on the market.

Filmmakers are now able to create wonders with cinematic, jaw dropping results that were earlier just impossible in Hollywood productions. But if you are new to this world of drone then you must be searching for some information regarding how to shoot aerial videos using drone to get professional results. If so, then don’t worry! Because the article below will provide you complete information about impressive filming techniques with latest drones.</p><p> Let’s check a video tutorial first:</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone"><a href="#Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Filming with Drone"></a>Tips for Filming with Drone</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Techniques</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Weather</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Editing</a></li></ul><h3 id="Techniques"><a href="#Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Techniques"></a>Techniques</h3><p> In order to get best results with your aerial shoot, try these professional techniques:</p><h4 id="1-Go-Slow"><a href="#1-Go-Slow" class="headerlink" title="1.  Go Slow"></a>1.  Go Slow</h4><p> The very first recommendation to beginners from professionals is to move slowly. It leaves cinematic impression on viewers as your slow motion makes them think that you are shooting from a larger platform such as helicopter. No doubt, it will increase the production value and shots will appear perfectly crafted and well controlled.</p><p> Ensure that you operate RC control stick very smoothly. Take help from gradual movements so that undesired shakes in footage can be avoided and at the same time care about slow acceleration and deceleration to avoid distortion from end results.</p><p> It is good to pre-plan as well as visual most of your aerial shots. One should prefer to advance guard his filming location so that all pros and cons can be pre-observed and proper planning can be done to get rid of limitations of that area. If you know your requirements in advance and have an effective plan for the site then you will definitely be able to make most out of your limited battery life of drone. You will not feel happy if some shots are missed just because of mismanagement and drained drone battery.</p><h4 id="2-Two-Axis-type-Movement"><a href="#2-Two-Axis-type-Movement" class="headerlink" title="2.  Two Axis type Movement"></a>2.  Two Axis type Movement</h4><p> There are few hidden tricks behind those breathtaking shots of big budget movies and it is good to implement them with care. Most of those professionals prefer to implement two axis type movements simultaneously. They often make some arrangements to fly backwards as well as downwards at the same time but note that such movements must be controlled at much smoother rate with stable adjustments.</p><h4 id="3-Strafe"><a href="#3-Strafe" class="headerlink" title="3.  Strafe"></a>3.  Strafe</h4><p> When you have to focus on attractive landscapes then the best idea is to use sideways movements or the strafing feature. It will help you to show landscapes with different prospective and results will naturally be more impressive. Usually, most of the shots over landscapes in Hollywood movies are recorded with aerial motions where drone keep on moving forward and backward, so if you try the strafing effect then it will definitely be a unique and awesome idea. This recording style will also help you to reveal various eye catching features of the landscape.</p><h4 id="4-Orbit"><a href="#4-Orbit" class="headerlink" title="4.  Orbit"></a>4.  Orbit</h4><p> If you want to achieve Orbit then you have to control your drone strafe movements towards left or right side while pulling that yaw stick to exactly opposite direction. Let me make it clear that yaw stick is a control stick that you will find on left side of your drone controller and it is there to control rotation action of drone. Note that, you need to have more practice on that yaw control because most of users, even professionals end up spinning much faster and results are too bad.</p><h4 id="5-Fly-Through-Shots"><a href="#5-Fly-Through-Shots" class="headerlink" title="5.  Fly Through Shots"></a>5.  Fly Through Shots</h4><p> Here is something more cinematic but it is going to be risky enough. You need to be more careful to capture this type of shots because it demands you complete attention on controller screen for drone navigation. If you believe on your piloting skills then you will definitely achieve success in this recording action. When these shots are captured perfectly, they have power to capture attention of viewers and they will soon become fan of your cinematography skills along with your risk management strategy.</p><h3 id="Weather"><a href="#Weather" class="headerlink" title="Weather"></a>Weather</h3><p> When we talk about weather then it is something out of your control and you have just one option that is to pray mercy from Mother Nature. To capture some of the best shots you will often need to fly in a clean sky and you definitely don’t need that heavy fog and rain. This issue is more common in winter days, especially when you are working on high altitudes that get freeze due to cold.</p><p><strong>What to do?</strong></p><ul><li>The first most important trick is to avoid taking shots in windy day. Generally, most of the advanced drone units can bear the pressure of up to 25-35 mph wind but if it goes above this range then your footage will get spoiled. It is not a good idea to simply rely on post processing techniques like jello effect etc. However, few professionals are able to refine their shots with Wrap Stabilization Setting to get best results.</li><li>Choose golden hours of the day to shoot your footage. The time of sunset and sunrise will help your footage to stand out as shadows are highly visible during this time and it will naturally create a natural impact. People rarely shoot scenes at sunrise time so you can try to implement this trick to prove yourself different from those common aerial shooters.</li></ul><h3 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h3><p> Some of the most common camera settings that demand your focus are flat image profile and shutter speed.</p><ul><li>**Flat Image Profile:**There is no doubt to say that your camera settings are going to leave great impact on your footage so use them effectively. Prefer to work on flattest camera profile as it will help you to get impressive dynamic range with aerial camera. This technique of shooting helps users to prevent clouds and sky and also helps users to retain details from darkest point on ground.</li><li><strong>Control Shutter Speed:</strong><br> It is good to work with lower shutter speed and in order to avoid strobing effect one must prefer to shot by keeping camera close to ground. Keep it somewhere around 100th to 250th level of second, one can also work with ND filter to control shutter speed to desired lower level. In case if you work with 500th or 100th part of second then you will naturally obtain sharper frames with it leads to footage with heavy strobing.</li></ul><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p> If you need to edit your shots to get customized results then it is most important to choose a professional and high quality software tool. One of the best professional recommendations is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> due to its intuitive interface and ability to edit 4k video shoots.

In case if you want to cut your video into multiple parts then simply repeat this process. But note that, you need to save those multiple sections of files one by one while deleting the unwanted portions.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Scene Detection:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection.jpg"                      alt="scene detection"                ></p><p> If you want to reach to certain segment of video quickly then use scene detection function. Just highlight your video on item tray and then right click, from the drop down menu, select “Scene Detection” option and now you can immediately separate your video into various parts as per need.

This desktop program can change your live voice to match your desired online character, whether voice chatting on Skype and Discord or playing on Steam and Valorant. But if you’re looking to use MorphVOX, it’s paramount to know that this program comes in two packages, the Junior and Pro versions. So, what’s the difference between the Junior and Pro versions? Let’s find out!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What is MorphVOX Junior voice changer?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer" >MorphVOX Junior <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free, open-source voice changer for Windows systems. This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.</p><p>You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.</p><p>However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That’s because it’s pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it’s an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-1.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What is MorphVOX Pro voice changer?</h2><p>If you’re unsatisfied with MorphVOX Junior, purchase <a class="link"   href="https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer" >MorphVOX Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for $39.99 only. Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It’s super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.</p><p>But the Junior version doesn’t come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.</p><p>Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files. All in all, this voice changer is worth every penny.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-2.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to use MorphVOX Junior to change voices on Discord. For those who don’t know, Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP app where users can share voice calls, video calls, media, and text messages. Although it’s compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, we’ll learn how to use it on Windows PC. Now follow me!</p><p>Step1 Assuming you already have a Discord account, head straight to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Junior.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-3.jpg"                      alt="download morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><p>Step2 Once the app is up and running, head to Discord and click the <strong>User Settings</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-4.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior open discord settings"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, tap <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> before choosing the <strong>Input Device</strong> as <strong>Screaming Bee Audio</strong>. You can also adjust <strong>Input Sensitivity</strong> by disabling the feature and then speak to your mic to change the sensitivity accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-5.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior choose discord input"                ></p><p>Step4 Lastly, head to MorphVOX voice changer and choose a magic voice.

Whether a professional or someone looking for a personal adventure video shooting device, GoPro has eased the job for everybody. Off late, Nikon the premier camera-manufacturing brand has introduced a series of Keymission action camera models. Recently, after the release of Keymission 170 (widely in glance for the 170 degree view), with features comparable to the <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black</strong>, there is much hype among the buyers when making a choice.

GoPro Comparison"></a>Comparative Analysis- Nikon Vs. GoPro Comparison</h4><h4 id="Design-Interface"><a href="#Design-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Design&amp; Interface"></a>Design&amp; Interface</h4><ol><li><strong>Weight &amp; Size</strong><br>The difference of 10g weight is not a big issue while the Nikon camera has larger dimensions. The small GoPro has a cute compact design having an appeal in itself.</li><li><strong>Screen Display</strong><br>Both these cameras have LCD display screen. You can control the menus, live streaming and other functions on the screen. With larger screen space and touch operation, GoPro is easy to handle. Comparing the screen, you will find better resolution, clarity and brighter display on GoPro.</li><li><strong>Interface</strong><br>The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> features dual shutters- separate for video and still image capturing allowing lesser adjustments in the settings. Switching between the video and photo modes in GoPro is easy to do via voice commands or the menu.</li></ol><h4 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><ol><li><strong>Photo Quality</strong><br>There is a notable difference in the performance of GoPro and Nikon when it comes to taking still images. With 12MP resolution (4000X3000 pixel settings) Hero 5 stands much ahead of Keymission 170 giving you the joy of capturing still photos at the resolution of 8.3MP (3840x2160 pixels). Another important convenience with GoPro is that you can take geo tagged photos besides the choice of shooting WDR and RAW photos. Nikon does not feature GPS configuration. You also cannot take RAW photos with Keymission 170.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-balck-keymission170-test1.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 test"                ></li><li><strong>Video Quality</strong><br>The video quality output of these cameras is the real point of attraction for all buyers. To all your relaxation, both of them can capture 4K30 (highest resolution) videos. Luckily, the quality of the videos is almost the same.Using the Protune settings on GoPro, you can get better results with sharpening, change ISO limits, take RAW videos with preferred audio settings, adjust the white balance etc. The first time users can use the default settings to capture good high-resolution videos. Keymission allows some limited adjustments with the Pro settings. You can obtain improved video quality by changing the white balance, exposure compensation and other details.<br><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmstocks.com/effects-store-upgrade.html" >Get Cool After Effects for Your Video&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br>Video Modes<br>When it comes to considering the availability of the video modes, the GoPro Hero 5 Black is the ultimate winner. You can get a range of video modes on this camera with varied pixels and fps combinations. The Keymission offers fewer choices to set the video capturing modes.<br>The GoPro works fine for the professionals looking to capture industry standard videos at 4K resolution.At normal speed, you can choose to set video modes at maximum of 2160p shooting at 30 or 25 fps. You can adjust the frame rate from 25 fps to 60fps while shooting at 1080 pixel resolution. These adjustments are sufficient if you are a beginner and want to get handy with action cameras.<br>Field of View (FOV)<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-black-keymission170-fov.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 fov"                ><br>As the name suggests, the Keymission 170 only offers the standard view of 170 degrees only. The degree is reduced a bit less when you are using the image stabilization feature. With flexible frame rate adjustments and resolution, you can use several FOV options including superview, wide, linear, medium, narrow etc. with GoPro Hero 5 Balck.<br>Stabilization<br>The video stabilization in Nikon Keymission 170 action camera is more advanced especially when you are using the external Gyrostabilizer.<br>White Balance<br>Nikon Keymission gives you an amazing feel with the yellowish orange effect when using the default white balance. This is much enhanced compared to that on the GoPro Hero 5 black. GoPro supports automatic white balance adjustment according to the ambiance and lights. While this feature is very advanced in the latest, model but not as that of the Nikon effect.<br>Low Light Video Capturing<br>There are shortcomings with both these cameras when you are shooting under low light availability. Yet, GoPro is a bit advanced to give you good video quality under low light. With Nikon it is preferable to use extra lights if you desire to get bright sharp objects.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-balck-keymission170-low-light-test.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 low light test"                ></li><li><strong>Audio Quality</strong><br>The Hero 5 Black is very tactically designed with dual microphones – at the rear and front ends. The camera can auto switch microphone during video capturing based on the requirements. To give you better sound quality, the camera swaps to the back microphone during heavy disturbing noise coming from the front direction like biking under heavy wind speed. The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> has built in stereo microphone to produce medium quality satisfactory sound capturing.</li></ol><h4 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h4><ol><li><strong>Waterproof&#x2F; Dust-Proof&#x2F;Freeze-Proof&#x2F;Shockproof</strong><br>Both of these are waterproof cameras and safe to use underwater at a depth of 10m. If you are going beyond 10m, the GoPro housing gives you the convenience to travel up to 60m deep while Nikon housing gives protection at depths up to 40m only.<br>As far as the other protection features are concerned, GoPro lacks dust resistance, freezer sustenance and shockproof protection. The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> with 2m shockproof protection can sustain knocks, shakes, jerks and bumps to some extent. Perfect for freezing points up to -10C&#x2F;14F, the camera is your best friend while skiing, snowboarding, snorkeling and going underwater in cold weather.</li><li><strong>Battery &amp; Memory</strong><br>Both these cameras function on lithium ion batteries (provided with the camera). <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black</strong> offers improved battery version allowing you to shoot 4k @ 24 fps videos for 2 hours. With the same settings, the Nikon battery will last for an hour of shooting.<br>On the memory card storage, Nikon rules indispensably. The double storage capacity of 128GB, the device works perfect while shooting 4K videos. You can store the entire stuff for over days of shooting. Even with the 64GB storage, GoPro can give you convenient space to store large standard video projects. However, you can change cards and later merge them during editing</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi &amp; App</strong><br>Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth<br>Both these cameras allow connectivity via Bluetooth and Wifi. The Wifi functions superbly to support live video streaming, photo capturing with apps etc.<br>App<br>Both Hero 5 Black and Keymission 170 allow app access on Android and iOS platforms. The Nikon’s SnapBridge app poses bug issues blocking seamless operation. As compared to this, the GoPro has a series of mobile apps you can use as per requirement. Apps like Capture, Quik and others make your camera operation easy. However, some of them may have error problems. It is better to choose in context to user ratings.</li></ol><h4 id="GoPro-Hero-5-Black-or-Nikon-Keymission-170-Which-is-the-Best-Buy-Action-Camera"><a href="#GoPro-Hero-5-Black-or-Nikon-Keymission-170-Which-is-the-Best-Buy-Action-Camera" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Hero 5 Black or Nikon Keymission 170- Which is the Best Buy Action Camera"></a>GoPro Hero 5 Black or Nikon Keymission 170- Which is the Best Buy Action Camera</h4><p>As with the pricing, both these cameras are available at almost the same range. As far as the Nikon vs. GoPro comparison on technological specifications are concerned, it is obvious that the Keymission 170 is a bit lacking in advancement. The model is somewhat near to the earlier GoPro Hero Session model priced at $199. With the same perfection and some extra detailing, Nikon at $399.99 is not worth any match for the <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black.</strong></p><h4 id="Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users"><a href="#Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users" class="headerlink" title="Recommend best video editing software for action camera users"></a><strong>Recommend best video editing software for action camera users</strong></h4><p>If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try.
