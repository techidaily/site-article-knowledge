However, episodes published just before noon does best in the afternoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-2.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><h3 id="Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast"><a href="#Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast"></a>Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast</h3><p>Here is our take on the podcast publish statistics analyzed by Megaphone in the charts above.</p><p><strong>1. Weekdays are much more popular than weekends</strong></p><p>From the podcast publish days’ statistics in the chart above, it’s obvious most podcasters publish on weekdays compared to weekends. Yes, over 40,000 podcast episodes are published during weekdays while on weekends, it’s within 4,000 to 5,000 episodes. The publishing time usually falls between 2 AM to 5 AM.</p><p>However, in our opinion, we don’t recommend publishing a new podcast at midnight, instead do it by 5 AM. This is will prevent the risk of your podcast getting buried under other podcasters’ shows on the app you are using, and enhance the chances of your podcast being on the first page, thus making it easily seen by your audience.</p><p><strong>2. When is the most popular publishing day?</strong></p><p>Based on the chart above, Wednesday is when the most podcast episodes are published. Over 9000 podcast episodes are published on this day, and the hour with the highest number of publishing is 2 AM.</p><p>But does this mean you should publish your podcast at exactly 2 AM on Wednesday? No! Instead, consider when your audience is most likely to listen. Will they prefer to tune in on their way to work, during work, on their way home, while doing house chores at home, or at night? You need to have a breakdown of this data, so you can choose the best time to publish your podcast.</p><p><strong>3. When is the worst?</strong></p><p>The worst day to publish a podcast is on Sunday, and as mentioned earlier, if you’re publishing during weekdays, do not publish at midnight. But note that the niche of your podcast matters. If Saturday and Sunday are when your audience tends to listen to your podcasts, then don’t hesitate to publish new episodes on weekends.</p><p>The hour with the most downloads per average episode is 5 AM Tuesday, followed by 5 AM Friday and 5 AM Thursday. Still, as mentioned earlier the time when your audience is most like to listen to the podcast matters.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do"><a href="#Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do"></a>Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do</h2><p>The charts above were published by Megaphone based on the podcast episodes published on their platform. However, if you intend to choose the days to publish a podcast based on that, then it’s sad to say you’re about to make a big mistake.</p><p>The truth is it takes time and consistency to find the best days to publish podcasts. Even successful podcasters you see today never had the best days have the best days to publish content when they started. So, before you rush to start posting your podcast based on the chart or how other podcasters upload content, here are things you should know;</p><h3 id="1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms"><a href="#1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms"></a>1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms</h3><p>If you conduct an analysis of how podcast platforms work, you’ll discover all podcast platforms don’t have the same algorithm. For example, the way the Apple Podcast app works can be the same as that of Spotify, Player FM, Stitcher, and many others.</p><p>During our review of different podcast apps, we discovered Apple Podcast app algorithm tends to favor newer episodes, except if you have a show you haven’t listened to in a while. There are also podcast apps with a similar algorithm, but the best time and day to publish podcasts varies.</p><h3 id="2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You"><a href="#2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You" class="headerlink" title="2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You"></a>2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You</h3><p>Just as the saying goes, “One man’s food could be another man’s poison”. Many regular podcasters usually upload content today because other podcasters have done the same. But unfortunately, it’s not a good move to just do things because others are doing it in the podcasting space. So, it’s advisable not to post at the same time others do.</p><h3 id="Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show"><a href="#Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show" class="headerlink" title="Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show"></a>Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show</h3><p>We absolutely can’t help you choose the best day to release a podcast. However, the following tips could help you decide what day and time will suit your podcast show.</p><p><strong>a. Avoid times when your audience will hardly listen to your podcast</strong></p><p>Most people look for podcasts when they are looking for information conversationally. So, you must do findings on knowing when your audience will want to listen to your podcast, though research shows that more people listen to podcasts on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday between 2 AM and 5 AM. But 5 AM is the best time to gather more downloads.</p><p><strong>b. Try to tie it to something more predictable</strong></p><p>Sometimes, you just need to think out of the box when choosing the best day for your podcast. For example, we know weekdays are for going to work, and more people tend to download podcasts by 5 AM on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. So, if your podcast is about “Things you should do at work to make your day less stressful”, there’s a high chance of getting more downloads, as it’ll attract many workers facing a similar problem daily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Regularly-Produce-Podcasts-for-Posting"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Regularly-Produce-Podcasts-for-Posting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Regularly Produce Podcasts for Posting?"></a>Part 4: How To Regularly Produce Podcasts for Posting?</h2><p>After making up your mind on the best day to release a podcast, your next move should be to start producing podcasts for posting.

You can understand!! So far, there is no clear surface but the game developers and designers are trying their best to solve problems by their own.

Ableton Live is one of the greatest DAWs to learn if you’re just beginning to make beats or write songs. For many artists, Ableton Live has emerged as the preferred setting for writing music with an eye on live performance. If you’re coming from a conventionally built digital audio workstation, Live’s approach to composition and arrangement is undoubtedly odd.</p><p>One of the most user-friendly pieces of music software ever created is Ableton Live. With a little instruction, you can quickly master Ableton fade and produce recordings of studio-caliber. Since then, Ableton has emerged as one of the top names in electronic music production. Live is a robust DAW with mature capabilities that can be used to produce any kind of music, although it works especially well with certain processes. Follow this guide to learn about Ableton fade in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton"><a href="#Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton"></a>Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton</h2><p>You’ve certainly heard the terms “audio fade-in” and “audio fade-out” a few times as a newbie, and you may be wondering what they mean and how you might apply them to your films. Crossfading clips on the same track is easier and only needs one track, however crossfading clips on different tracks allows you to apply independent audio effects processing and gives greater flexibility in structuring the fade curves. Both strategies may be helpful for organizing and creating sounds.</p><h3 id="Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades"></a>Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades</h3><p>To avoid any clicks, turn on Create Fades on Clip Edges in the Record&#x2F;Warp&#x2F;Launch section of Live’s Preferences. The beginning and ending of the Clip will each have a little fade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-fades-warp-fades.jpg"                      alt="create fades warp fades"                ></p><p>You must disable the automated mode in order to alter the clip fades. You may accomplish this by doing the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/disable-automated-mode-ableton.jpg"                      alt="disable automated mode ableton"                ></p><p>The fade-in and fade-out handles should display when you hover the mouse icon over the audio clip you want to fade. In case, if they don’t, hit ‘A’ on your keyboard to make them appear. Then, you hold down the mouse button while left-clicking on the handle you wish to fade and lowering the fader.</p><h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track" class="headerlink" title="Way 2.

It will load the Utility effect to the specified MIDI track wherever you drag it on the track. Left-click on the little box in the bottom right corner of the DAW to view the Utility effect on your track. Follow the procedure below to do so.<br>Live’s ability to easily clean up the beginning and conclusion of audio samples has long been one of its strengths. Simply hit A and hover over the clip to check sure Automation Mode isn’t turned on. There are two handles you may drag on the left and right, as well as two curve adjusters:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/midi-track-ableton.jpg"                      alt="midi track ableton"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It may differ due to embedded audio, different frame sizes, and Aspect Ratios. Let us take an example of a video:</p><p>The Framerate &#x3D; 30</p><p>The Bitrate &#x3D; 25</p><p>The Format &#x3D; HDV 720</p><p>In this case, the total space occupied by this 24- hour video file is 263.67 GB.</p><p>The most important factor in measuring the file size is the bit rate. <strong>The Bitrate is the measure of the amount of information transmitted every second</strong>. It is measured in Mbps or Kbps. Following is the table, you can use to adjust the file size with different bit rates and frame rates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-file-size-1.jpg"                      alt="video-file-size"                ></p><p><strong>What is a Video Compression?</strong></p><p><strong>“The process of reducing the video size to</strong></p><p> <strong>upload and download fast is known as the File Compression”</strong></p><p>A good video compressor can easily reduce the size of a video up to 1000 times smaller than the original video. It seems difficult but it’s pretty simple, you have not to do it with your hands like cutting down the stuff instead there are a number of tools and applications that reduces the size of a file within n few seconds in the palm of your hand.</p><p>The question is, why would you need to reduce the size of a file?</p><p>When you export large video files, it would take hours to upload. Alternatively, if you are using google drive or drop box, they limit to management space you have unless you have to pay for it.</p><p>I would share some examples of I have been working with a client. One of the things he asked me is to make a large video, edit it and send me within a day. However, it was really difficult for me to put such a large video file, upload it into a hard drive and then ship it. Since the video is too long and I need to compress the video footage. Therefore, I compressed my file using file compression tool and timely sent my task to the client. In this article, you would learn how to how to compress a large video file into a smaller one without compromising the quality of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-file-size-2.jpg"                      alt="video-file-size"                ></p><h2 id="Can-I-Reduce-the-File-Size-for-a-Long-Video"><a href="#Can-I-Reduce-the-File-Size-for-a-Long-Video" class="headerlink" title="Can I Reduce the File Size for a Long Video?"></a><strong>Can I Reduce the File Size for a Long Video?</strong></h2><p>Yes, you can compress your large video file into a smaller video within a few clicks in seconds. If you shoot a video on your cell phone, you need to compress it before sending it to cloud storage as the original file will take up a big space on the cloud storage. In the same way, if you need to send a file via email, you need to reduce the size of your file as you can only send a maximum of 25 MB file.</p><p>You can simply compress your large video file into a compressed or small video file without losing the quality of the final video whether you are using Windows, Mac, iPhone, or whatever the device is. In the same way, you can compress your YouTube videos to easily edit short videos, take less space for uploading, and are buffered fast at the viewer’s end.</p><h2 id="How-do-Compress-a-Long-Video-to-a-Small-Size"><a href="#How-do-Compress-a-Long-Video-to-a-Small-Size" class="headerlink" title="How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?"></a><strong>How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?</strong></h2><p>A properly compressed file can easily be uploaded and downloaded and in some cases, playback will be smoother. This can easily be done without losing the quality of the video. Compressing a video reduces the file size of the video. So, takes less space on your hard drive. For example; a <strong>100MB</strong> video can be compressed into an <strong>8MB</strong> video with no visible difference.</p><p>There are two simple methods to reduce the size of your video:</p><p>Firstly, you can trim the unnecessary beginning and end parts of your video. It will help you reduce the video size.</p><p>Secondly, you can remove the unnecessary audio, if your video looks good without background music, you can delete it to get the extra space. Sometimes, the actions in the video are so powerful that there is no need for audio. In this case, you can remove audio and get space without losing the quality of the video.</p><p>On the other hand, a video compressor can harm your data and corrupt your file so, you should use proper software by following these steps to avoid data loss. Let’s move forward and I will introduce a few tools which help you further in reducing the size of your video.</p><h3 id="Using-Wonder-Share-Filmora-11"><a href="#Using-Wonder-Share-Filmora-11" class="headerlink" title="Using Wonder Share Filmora 11"></a><strong>Using Wonder Share Filmora 11</strong></h3><p>Compressing a video file seems really complicated but today I will show you how to change the video parameters of a large video file for free using a very professional software known as <strong>Wonder Share Filmora 11</strong>.

Malware infections and potentially unwanted programs are an outcome of downloading from an unreliable source. There are many websites that specialize in dispersing malicious payloads by providing the downloader with something legitimate or bundling the required installer with some extra programs.</p><p>There are many threat initiators who look for the terms that are gaining popularity in the search results and seek out the terminated software downloads. Thereafter, they try to attract searchers to the website. These people use SEO techniques for ranking higher in the search engines. As a matter of fact, they might also spend a few dollars to show up in the search engine’s sponsored section. These sites hide their malware in the malvertising as downloads.</p><p>The threat actors just make sure that the searchers believe that they have found what they are looking for. If they are convinced, they are going to download and install the infected driver all by themselves. The threat actor just uploads the malware under a file name that will be convincing enough for attracting visitors to the website.</p><p>Section1. <a href="#s1">How to Assess a Website?</a></p><p>Section2. <a href="#s2">Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac</a></p><p>Section3. <a href="#s3">Top Websites to Download VLC Player for Mac for Free</a></p><p>Section4. <a href="#s4">How to Download and Install VLC Player on Mac?

This shows that the site has got a security certificate. However, this isn’t a guarantee that the website is safe for downloading the VLC player software.</p><p>SSL certificates come at a cheap price and a cybercriminal knows where they can get them almost for free. So, click on the green padlock to find out who has issued the certificate. You can also check the other sites that have received their SSL certificate from this particular authority.</p><h3 id="•-Use-a-Browser-Extension-or-a-Trusted-Anti-Virus-Software"><a href="#•-Use-a-Browser-Extension-or-a-Trusted-Anti-Virus-Software" class="headerlink" title="• Use a Browser Extension or a Trusted Anti-Virus Software"></a>• Use a Browser Extension or a Trusted Anti-Virus Software</h3><p>There are many free applications and browser extensions that will warn you about shady sites. This software can alert you when you try to open a site that they know to be the home of scammers and malware. Install such software or add it to your browser to recognize malicious sites and domains.</p><h3 id="•-Read-Third-Party-Reviews"><a href="#•-Read-Third-Party-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="• Read Third-Party Reviews"></a>• Read Third-Party Reviews</h3><p>There are some websites where you will find reviews on the download domains and sites. Albeit, some of these sites are reputable, they might fall behind when it comes to adding new users. Cybercriminals can dump a new domain just like that when it gets too many bad reviews and then purchase a new site from where they can run their scheme. So, when you are reading reviews, make sure that you are choosing sites that have been around for some time.</p><p>In case a site doesn’t have reviews, it means it has only started operating and it might be up to no good.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Tips-to-Filter-Malware-from-the-VLC-Download-Files-for-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Tips-to-Filter-Malware-from-the-VLC-Download-Files-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac"></a>Section 2.Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac</h2><p>There are a few methods that you can use to weed out the malware from the downloaded files.</p><h3 id="•-Check-The-Digital-Signature-Of-The-File"><a href="#•-Check-The-Digital-Signature-Of-The-File" class="headerlink" title="• Check The Digital Signature Of The File"></a>• Check The Digital Signature Of The File</h3><p>The digital signature of a file can be verified after you have downloaded it. This shows if the downloaded file has been signed by the particular party.</p><p>Every cybercriminal has one thing in common. They know how to trick people. Hence, you should just accept a website to be trustworthy and download the VLC file simply because it features the logo of a trustworthy company on the homepage. Logo images are available online and they can be planted on a malware site.</p><h3 id="•-Compare-the-Checksum-To-The-Actual-File"><a href="#•-Compare-the-Checksum-To-The-Actual-File" class="headerlink" title="• Compare the Checksum To The Actual File"></a>• Compare the Checksum To The Actual File</h3><p>A checksum is actually a sequence of letters or numbers used for checking data for errors. In case you know that the checksum is an original file, compare it to the file that you have downloaded. Mac has built-in options for calculating the file’s checksum.</p><h3 id="•-Run-A-Malware-Scan"><a href="#•-Run-A-Malware-Scan" class="headerlink" title="• Run A Malware Scan"></a>• Run A Malware Scan</h3><p>You can also use an anti-malware scanner. This can double-check if you are downloading an infected file.</p><h2 id="Section-3-Top-Websites-to-Download-VLC-Player-for-Mac-for-Free"><a href="#Section-3-Top-Websites-to-Download-VLC-Player-for-Mac-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Section 3.Top Websites to Download VLC Player for Mac for Free"></a>Section 3.Top Websites to Download VLC Player for Mac for Free</h2><p>In case you are looking for a website to download VLC player on your Mac, check out these top choices given below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/vlc-media-player-screenshot.jpg"                                     ></p><p>• <a class="link"   href="https://www.videolan.org/" >VideoLAN.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: This is the official site to download VLC media player for free.</p><p>• CNET: This is one of the trustworthy websites offering the VLC player for free.

So, the Metaverse is surely something that everybody is looking forward to.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-androids-lightroom-app-an-in-depth-analysis-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exploring Android's Lightroom App  An In-Depth Analysis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/unlimited-potential-with-best-in-class-pp-templates/"><u>Unlimited Potential with Best-in-Class PP Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-key-to-unlocking-the-best-video-production-talents/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Key to Unlocking the Best Video Production Talents</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-the-telegram-edge-advanced-tactics-for-effective-promotion-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Telegram Edge  Advanced Tactics for Effective Promotion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-maximize-reach-in-telegram-a-marketers-playbook/"><u>[Updated] Maximize Reach in Telegram  A Marketer's Playbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-your-photography-with-polarrs-complete-features/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your Photography with Polarr's Complete Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essential-handbook-for-periscope-video-logging/"><u>In 2024, The Essential Handbook for Periscope Video Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-transcription-mastery-for-office-productivity-using-microsoft-words-voice-recognition-features/"><u>[Updated] Transcription Mastery for Office Productivity  Using Microsoft Word's Voice Recognition Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/studio-techniques-decoded-xvideostudio-edition/"><u>Studio Techniques Decoded  XVideoStudio Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-ways-to-learn-discord-game-bots-even-if-youre-just-starting-out-20/"><u>New Ways to Learn Discord Game Bots – Even if Youre Just Starting Out 20</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-remove-drums-from-a-song-online-easy-tips-and-tricks/"><u>New Remove Drums From a Song Online Easy Tips and Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-game-on-a-comprehensive-guide-to-xbox-one-captures/"><u>[New] In 2024, Game On  A Comprehensive Guide to Xbox One Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-poco-c65-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Unlock a Poco C65 Easily?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tips-for-recording-high-quality-video-in-zoom/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tips for Recording High-Quality Video in Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/3-effective-ways-to-bypass-activation-lock-on-iphone-7-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on iPhone 7 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-zoom-your-stories-to-attention-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[New] Zoom Your Stories to Attention on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-phone-number-from-your-apple-id-on-your-iphone-14-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Remove Phone Number From Your Apple ID on Your iPhone 14 Plus?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-list-of-bgm-audio-archives/"><u>Updated The Ultimate List of BGM Audio Archives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/smartphone-simplicity-meets-online-impact-making-videos-easy-for-2024/"><u>Smartphone Simplicity Meets Online Impact  Making Videos Easy for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <updated>2024-06-12T16:37:25.726Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="‘21-Edition-Examination-–-The-Gambler’s-Guide-to-Vegas-Pro"><a href="#‘21-Edition-Examination-–-The-Gambler’s-Guide-to-Vegas-Pro" class="headerlink" title="‘21 Edition Examination – The Gambler’s Guide to Vegas Pro"></a>‘21 Edition Examination – The Gambler’s Guide to Vegas Pro</h2><p>A fresh take on the traditional video editing program is VEGAS Pro 19. New name, new features, but is VEGAS still the same under the surface? VEGAS has always involved some dice-rolling. In our evaluation of VEGAS Movie Studio 17, the video editor received a definite 2.5-star average (the same goes for VEGAS Movie Studio 15).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vegas-pro-19.jpg"                      alt="vegas pro 19"                ></p><p>We criticized the software, saying that it was “not as good as the VEGAS name would have you believe.” Although some tools are incorporated in a very brilliant, innovative, and intuitive way, on the whole it feels too restricting away from your most basic demands. Your alternatives are restricted, or excessively concealed, overly complex, or unclear.</p><p>However, we are all still developing. In the same way, VEGAS Pro 19 offers a number of new tools that are suited for both novice and experienced video editors, even though it isn’t considered to be one of the best alternatives to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="Color-grading"><a href="#Color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Color grading"></a>Color grading</h2><p>Changing the interface’s colors to make the experience better when editing is one thing, but it’s also good to</p><p>see that actual color correction has been improved as well.</p><p>The Grading Panel has been redesigned, like thinner looking range-limited color wheels, which give you more</p><p>control over the adjustments you’re making.</p><p>VEGAS also comes with 40 LUTs, and expanded individual R, G, B curves, among others, making color correction work more precise and enjoyable than before.</p><h2 id="Track-effects"><a href="#Track-effects" class="headerlink" title="Track effects"></a>Track effects</h2><p>Thankfully, not all of the links go to paid internet services. For your workflow, VEGAS Pro offers a number of great new additions. “Adjustment Tracks” is one of these. You can apply filters to entire tracks rather of needing to add them to individual segments.</p><p>By doing so, you may apply the same effects to numerous clips and manage their settings from a single area. Even better, you can keyframe these effects directly from the timeline to change their intensity over time. It’s simply some incredible visual effects software that wasn’t even imaginable previously in VEGAS.</p><h2 id="Scene-detection"><a href="#Scene-detection" class="headerlink" title="Scene detection"></a>Scene detection</h2><p>With version 19, VEGAS added a brand-new feature. They believe it to be so crucial that they have offered three options for doing it: split it whenever a cut occurs, examine finished, exported projects that you’ve brought back to the editing suite. Since we’ve been editing short films for almost 20 years, we haven’t needed to do it very often, but since we’re hoarders, most of our work are still accessible and editable. We become aware of how outnumbered we are as a result of this new characteristic.</p><h2 id="Upscale-options"><a href="#Upscale-options" class="headerlink" title="Upscale options"></a>Upscale options</h2><p>Upscaling is a fascinating advancement as well. The prior filter was getting on in years, but VEGAS has since unveiled a new AI-based one that performs far better. It claims to be able to transcode SD film (720x480) all the way up to 4K. (3840 x 2160). The filter has a straightforward slider; the higher you move it, the closer and more in-depth the clip will be with AI.</p><p>Naturally, the effects will be better the crisper and cleaner the source clip is. To be sure, the gadget is a surprising advancement, but one that is welcome. particularly when compared to earlier iterations of the video editing program.</p><h2 id="VEGAS-Hub"><a href="#VEGAS-Hub" class="headerlink" title="VEGAS Hub"></a>VEGAS Hub</h2><p>The addition of the VEGAS Hub is one of the most noticeable visual changes. In both the form of a large login button at the top of the interface and a tab directly over the timeline.</p><p>VEGAS’ online presence is expanding, but the majority of the fun new features will only be available to subscribers. These days, it seems impossible to escape subscriptions; popular editors like Adobe Premiere Pro and Cyberlink PowerDirector both contain them. However, similar to PowerDirector, you have the option of subscribing or buying the software altogether.</p><p>One of these benefits is the capability to sync media between devices and save it online. It implies that moviemakers can use their smartphones to capture video, edit it, and then post it to the Hub. By the time you return to your editing station, those clips will be prepared.</p><p>Text to Speech, another intriguing subscription-only feature, speaks any sentences you provide it with using computer-generated voices.</p><h2 id="Price-points"><a href="#Price-points" class="headerlink" title="Price points"></a>Price points</h2><p>With the new “Automatic Scene Detection,” you no longer need to manually clip your file if you need to re-edit or use a project but no longer have access to the original material, only the finished product. Selecting the file from the Project Media folder and selecting “Detect Scenes and Add to Timeline” are two options for doing this. VEGAS examines it, makes edits, and inserts each segment in turn to the timeline where the playhead is situated.</p><p>The same thing may be accomplished by choosing the alternative option of “Detect Scenes and Create Subclips,” except that it won’t add anything to the timeline and will instead add subclips of each cut to your Project Media folder. The last item is “Scene Detection” under Video FX. You have certain customization choices with this filter that are not available with the other two approaches. You have access to three sliders that allow you to alter the cuts’ sensitivity.</p><p>Who else is transitioning to a subscription model? VEGAS is. But those who favor paying for a perpetual license haven’t yet been forgotten. VEGAS Edit costs $250, Pro costs $400, and Post costs $600. In actuality, this is less expensive than the prior iteration. The cost of a subscription is either $13, $20, or $30 each month.</p><p>The subscription model does offer benefits in addition to those already highlighted. For instance, Edit offers 20 royalty-free HD films and stock music samples for download each month along with 20GB of cloud storage.</p><p>With Pro, you have unlimited access to their material catalog, 50GB of additional online storage, VEGAS Stream streaming software, the top-notch Primatte chroma-keying program, and Sound Forge audio editing tools.</p><p>You get 100GB of cloud storage with Post, along with the photo editor VEGAS Image and the high-end visual effects compositing software VEGAS Effects.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-expert-tips-on-choosing-top-9-webcam-enhancement-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, Expert Tips on Choosing Top 9 Webcam Enhancement Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-achieving-professional-hdr-images-with-adobe-ps/"><u>2024 Approved  Achieving Professional HDR Images with Adobe PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-reviving-photo-viewer-on-win-11-methods-explained/"><u>[New] Reviving Photo Viewer on Win 11 - Methods Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/ultimate-choice-for-gif-to-video-online-tools-best-5-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate Choice for GIF-to-Video Online Tools (Best 5) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-windows-10-new-features-at-a-glance/"><u>In 2024, Windows 10 New Features at a Glance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-whatsapps-call-conversations/"><u>[New] Unveiling WhatsApp's Call Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-screen-success-brand-endorsement-strategies/"><u>[New] Screen Success  Brand Endorsement Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exclusive-choice-premium-virtual-reality-experiences-on-google-cardboard/"><u>2024 Approved  Exclusive Choice  Premium Virtual Reality Experiences on Google Cardboard</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/catch-or-beat-sleeping-snorlax-on-pokemon-go-for-realme-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Catch or Beat Sleeping Snorlax on Pokemon Go For Realme 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/aural-tapestry-weaving-sounds-into-cinematic-threads-for-2024/"><u>Aural Tapestry  Weaving Sounds Into Cinematic Threads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-lava-blaze-2-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best Ways on How to Unlock/Bypass/Swipe/Remove Lava Blaze 2 Fingerprint Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-cutting-the-clutter-techniques-for-isolating-signal-in-remote-audio-broadcasts/"><u>New Cutting the Clutter Techniques for Isolating Signal in Remote Audio Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-nokia-130-music-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Nokia 130 Music? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-advanced-screen-recording-of-facetime-dialogues/"><u>[New] Advanced Screen Recording of FaceTime Dialogues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/all-must-knows-to-use-fake-gps-go-location-spoofer-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>All Must-Knows to Use Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer On Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Strategic-Plan-for-Top-Tier-Advertising-Results"><a href="#A-Strategic-Plan-for-Top-Tier-Advertising-Results" class="headerlink" title="A Strategic Plan for Top-Tier Advertising Results"></a>A Strategic Plan for Top-Tier Advertising Results</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-1.jpg"                      alt="introduction"                ></p><p>Within the world of social media marketing, there are many different strategies. All of these options can make it easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>But don’t worry! We’ve got some tried-and-true tips that can help you get started on your SMM journey.</p><h2 id="What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM"><a href="#What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM" class="headerlink" title="What is social media marketing (SMM)?"></a>What is social media marketing (SMM)?</h2><p>Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.</p><p>Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.</p><p>So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.</p><p><strong>1. Design Your Strategies</strong></p><p>You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.</p><p>After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it’s consistent!</p><p>Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values&#x2F;beliefs&#x2F;needs&#x2F;desires (whatever they may be).</p><p>Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).</p><p><strong>2. Starting Live Broadcast</strong></p><p>Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.</p><p>If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.</p><p>What You’ll Need:</p><ul><li>A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.</li><li>When using a laptop, ensure there’s no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what’s happening on screen when watching via computer&#x2F;laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).</li></ul><p><strong>3. Social Media Influencer</strong></p><p>Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p><p>Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.</p><p>Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts&#x2F;content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-2.jpg"                      alt="social media influencer"                ></p><p><strong>4. Create Subscription Options</strong></p><p>Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.</p><p>To create a subscription option:</p><ul><li>Navigate to “Customize” on the top right corner of your page and select “Subscription Options” from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Enter your desired name and description, then click “Save Changes” at the bottom of this section</li><li>To set up a subscription:</li></ul><p><strong>5. Engage with your Audience</strong></p><p>Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:</p><ul><li>Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they’re being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.</li><li>Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.</li><li>Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!</li></ul><p><strong>6. Create User Generated Content</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember that social media is about the community, so it’s important to encourage your audience members to create content.</p><p>If you’re not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you’re losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:</p><ul><li>Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.</li><li>If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Create a Positive Brand Image</strong></p><p>Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.</p><p>Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website’s design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-3.jpg"                      alt="create a positive brand image"                ></p><p>It’s a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there’s no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.</p><p><strong>8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand</strong></p><p>The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.</p><p>Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.</p><p><strong>9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends</strong></p><p>Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.</p><p><strong>10. Participate in Social Media Events</strong></p><p>Social media events can be a great way to get your name out there and promote your brand.</p><ul><li>They are a good way to get new leads.</li><li>You can also use social media events to build your brand’s reputation.</li></ul><h2 id="BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message"><a href="#BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message" class="headerlink" title="BONUS: Just keep sending out a message"></a>BONUS: Just keep sending out a message</h2><p>One of the most important things to remember is that consistency is the key.

It’s time to stop wasting time and money on ineffective videos that don’t get results. If you follow the tips below, you’ll have a solid strategy for creating professional-looking testimonial videos that your customers will love and share.</p><h2 id="Identify-Your-Perfect-Customer"><a href="#Identify-Your-Perfect-Customer" class="headerlink" title="Identify Your Perfect Customer"></a>Identify Your Perfect Customer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/identify-your-perfect-customer.jpg"                      alt="identify your perfect customer"                ></p><p>The first key tactic to creating a perfect testimonial video is identifying your perfect customer. The more you know about the type of person who will benefit the most from using your product or service, the better you can tailor your video content to speak directly to them.</p><p>It may seem like a daunting task, but there are several ways you can go about defining who this person is:</p><ul><li>If possible, talk with current customers and ask them what they love about their experience with your business.</li><li>If that’s not an option for some reason (maybe there aren’t any current customers), consider hiring a research firm or marketing agency that specializes in surveying potential customers and asking questions like “What would encourage you to buy from us?” or “How could we improve our service?” With this information in hand, it should be easier than ever before!</li></ul><h2 id="Ask-Authentic-Questions"><a href="#Ask-Authentic-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Ask Authentic Questions"></a>Ask Authentic Questions</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ask-authentic-questions.jpg"                      alt="ask authentic questions"                ></p><ul><li>Open-ended questions are the best way to engage customers and get them to speak naturally.</li><li>Make your question relevant to the customer and your product or service.</li><li>The more specific you can be with these questions, the better. For example, if you’re selling pet products online, ask about their pets’ names, breed, and color (if applicable).</li><li>If there’s no good reason for asking a question then don’t! For example: “How was your experience with our website?”</li></ul><h2 id="Include-Strong-Opinions"><a href="#Include-Strong-Opinions" class="headerlink" title="Include Strong Opinions"></a>Include Strong Opinions</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/include-strong-opinion.jpg"                      alt="include strong opinion"                ></p><ul><li>Use the word “I”.</li><li>Use the word “we”.</li><li>Use the word “you”.</li><li>You can also use the word “they” for an authoritative tone, or “them”, which is more casual and vaguer, depending on what you want to convey.</li><li>Please avoid saying the word “me” because this makes it sound like you’re speaking in the third person—which can come across as unnatural and pretentious.</li></ul><h2 id="Keep-it-All-Short-and-Sweet"><a href="#Keep-it-All-Short-and-Sweet" class="headerlink" title="Keep it All Short and Sweet"></a>Keep it All Short and Sweet</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keep-video-short-and-sweet.jpg"                      alt="keep video short and sweet"                ></p><p>When creating your video testimonial, you want to keep it short and sweet. After all, that’s the point of using video testimonials in the first place! Make sure you have a tight script with a few specific questions written down. You should also plan out how you’re going to arrange these questions into a flow.</p><p>When asking someone for their thoughts on a topic or issue, there’s always going to be some variation in how people respond. Some will talk about personal experiences; others will talk about what they’ve learned from others’ experiences; still, others might share some advice for future generations who might encounter similar problems. The key here is that your main objective is not necessarily the information itself (though this can help), but rather the emotion behind it—what effect does this experience have on your audience?</p><p>Asking open-ended questions allows people greater freedom when responding—and while this may sound like an ideal situation when creating content, it often results in less-than-ideal responses when creating content at scale since you won’t always get exactly what you want out of every shot.</p><h2 id="Lighting-Sound-and-Video-Quality-Matter"><a href="#Lighting-Sound-and-Video-Quality-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Lighting, Sound, and Video Quality Matter"></a>Lighting, Sound, and Video Quality Matter</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/lighting-sound-video-quality.jpg"                      alt="lighting sound video quality"                ></p><p>Lighting, sound, and video quality matter.</p><p>This is a given. If you want your testimonial videos to be effective and believable, they need to be properly lit, recorded with good audio quality, and captured in high resolution. While these may seem like obvious must-haves for any video production project—and they are—it’s important to remember that there are many factors at play when it comes to how your audience will perceive the final product.</p><h2 id="Really-Listen-to-Your-Prospects"><a href="#Really-Listen-to-Your-Prospects" class="headerlink" title="Really Listen to Your Prospects"></a>Really Listen to Your Prospects</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/listen-to-your-prospects.jpg"                      alt="listen to your prospects"                ></p><p>When you’re listening to your customers, don’t just take notes on what they say. Also, look at their body language and eye movement. This can tell you a lot about whether they are telling the truth or not, and it will give you an idea of what may be going on in their head.</p><p>If someone says “I love this product,” but then shows their eyes darting around nervously, that could mean that they’re worried about saying something nice about the product because it’s not really meeting their needs. If someone says “It’s okay,” but he or she is nodding along with enthusiasm when talking about it, that probably means he or she really does like it!</p><h2 id="Beware-of-Skeptics-and-Negative-Nellies"><a href="#Beware-of-Skeptics-and-Negative-Nellies" class="headerlink" title="Beware of Skeptics and Negative Nellies"></a>Beware of Skeptics and Negative Nellies</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/beware-skeptics.jpg"                      alt="beware skeptics"                ></p><p>You might have skeptics and negative nellies in your audience. They’re the ones who are less likely to buy, but more likely to be negative about everything.</p><p>These people will try to poke holes in what you’ve done and make it sound like your product or service isn’t worth buying no matter what you do for them. Luckily for us, there are a few things we can do about this!</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you’re looking to boost your sales with testimonial videos, then you need to be sure that they reflect the quality of your product or service. Customers will be more likely to trust a testimonial if it’s given by someone who seems authentic and honest in their praise. Try these tactics out for yourself and see what results in you get!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-the-heart-of-storytelling-engaging-dialogue-in-scripts/"><u>[Updated] The Heart of Storytelling  Engaging Dialogue in Scripts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-top-techniques-for-incorporating-hyperlinks-into-tiktok-profiles/"><u>[New] Top Techniques for Incorporating Hyperlinks Into TikTok Profiles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-trending-decor-ideas-for-livestreaming/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Trending Decor Ideas for Livestreaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mac-and-windows-compatible-srt-boosters-the-elite-list-of-10/"><u>2024 Approved  Mac & Windows Compatible SRT Boosters  The Elite List of 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-professional-image-perfection-the-premier-iphone-object-removal-apps/"><u>[Updated] Professional Image Perfection  The Premier iPhone Object Removal Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-subtitle-manipulators-the-top-10-list-online/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Best Subtitle Manipulators - The Top 10 List (Online)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-embracing-metaverse-characters-a-guide-to-seamless-avatars/"><u>[Updated] Embracing Metaverse Characters  A Guide to Seamless Avatars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-the-multilingual-maven-writes-on-cutting-edge-video-translators-ranked-23/"><u>[New] The Multilingual Maven’ Writes On  Cutting-Edge Video Translators Ranked 23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capture-and-share-your-mac-life-free/"><u>2024 Approved  Capture & Share Your Mac Life, FREE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-3-sites-to-find-free-gionee-unlock-codes-to-unlock-your-gionee-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 3 Sites to Find Free Gionee Unlock Codes to Unlock Your Gionee Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-breakthrough-tools-an-analysis-of-the-top-10-cost-effective-video-design-schools-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, Breakthrough Tools  An Analysis of the Top 10 Cost-Effective Video Design Schools on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cinematic-slow-motion-top-video-editors-for-dramatic-effects/"><u>Updated In 2024, Cinematic Slow Motion Top Video Editors for Dramatic Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/mastering-call-recording-on-google-voice-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Mastering Call Recording on Google Voice A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-3-realme-11-5g-emulator-for-mac-to-run-your-wanted-android-apps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Best 3 Realme 11 5G Emulator for Mac to Run Your Wanted Android Apps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/professional-drone-review-best-5-to-consider/"><u>Professional Drone Review  Best 5 to Consider</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-trade-pokemon-go-from-far-away-on-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Ways to trade pokemon go from far away On Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/unlock-chromecast-how-to-play-any-video-file-format/"><u>Unlock Chromecast How to Play Any Video File Format</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, there are several websites for high quality images you can access, provided you know where to look. As you keep reading, you will discover the best ways to get high resolution background images for websites, ad campaigns, and social media posts.</p><p>In addition, the methods you will encounter are all free, and you will also find detailed guides on how to use each method. As such, you can commercialize your creations immediately after reading this article.</p><h2 id="Part1-Search-for-the-origin-of-high-quality-pictures"><a href="#Part1-Search-for-the-origin-of-high-quality-pictures" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Search for the origin of high quality pictures"></a>Part1: Search for the origin of high quality pictures</h2><p>How many high quality pictures and videos do social media and other online platforms handle daily? Here are the numbers for your reference. Internet users <a class="link"   href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/amazing-social-media-statistics-and-facts/" >share over 3.2 billion images and <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over 720,000 hours of video daily. As such, you will discover different quality photos available everywhere.</p><p>However, there are several verified sites where you can find a high quality version of pictures for free. Below are the three top methods you should consider:</p><h3 id="1-Google-Image-Search"><a href="#1-Google-Image-Search" class="headerlink" title="1. Google Image Search"></a>1. Google Image Search</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/high-quality-pictures-1.jpg"                      alt="google image search"                ></p><p>Google is by far the largest information source on the internet. As such, it should also be your number one source for high quality pictures. In addition, the search engine offers a separate service known as Google Image search, which allows you to get pictures across any subject.</p><p>However, you need to employ several filters when looking for high resolution images for websites. For example, you need to filter results by resolution and usage rights. This is because some photographers offer their work on the internet for commercial purposes, and using it without authorization can get you in serious trouble.</p><p>Below is how to get high quality versions of pictures for free using Google Image search:</p><ul><li>Open your browser and proceed to <strong>Google Search</strong>.</li><li>Once there, click on Images at the top right corner to launch the <strong>Google Image</strong> search.</li><li>Type your search query in the text box, and press <strong>Enter</strong> to receive your search results.</li><li>Then, click on <strong>Tools</strong> to open additional filters, and select <strong>Creative Commons licenses</strong> under the <strong>Usage Rights</strong> option. Images under the creative commons license are free to use for personal and commercial licenses, depending on the hosting site.</li></ul><p>Sometimes, users may remove the metadata of an image, making it difficult to know if an image is genuinely free to use. Therefore, always double-check its legality using reverse image search tools such as PicSearch and TinEye Reverse Image Search.</p><h3 id="2-Stock-media-sites-image-search-Unsplash-supports-the-feature"><a href="#2-Stock-media-sites-image-search-Unsplash-supports-the-feature" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, before downloading photos from them, you need to familiarize yourself with the following terms:</p><ul><li><strong>Creative Commons</strong></li></ul><p>This nonprofit organization enables sharing your creativity and expertise with others through free channels. It provided different creative commons licenses, each with different rules of use of the content. For example, you can only use Unsplash-licensed content for free after making artistic alterations. As such, the image is completely different from the creator’s, making it your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Royalty-free high-resolution pictures</strong></li></ul><p>Although they contain the word free in their name, images with this title are necessarily so. This is because some sites require you to pay a one-time access fee to their library. In addition, websites for high quality images like Unsplash dedicate an entire category that features only royalty-free photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Public Domain</strong></li></ul><p>Public domain content is creative assets whose copyrights are under these classifications: expired, forfeited, or inapplicable. However, you should remember that not all internet items are public domain content.</p><h3 id="3-Post-the-photo-in-relevant-communities"><a href="#3-Post-the-photo-in-relevant-communities" class="headerlink" title="3.

As such, you can also play your part by submitting your creations to relevant communities. This is because it helps improve image search engine accuracy and promotes growth in picture categories. Some sites where you can submit your creations include Pinterest, Getty Images, Instagram, and Flickr.</p><h2 id="Part2-Enhance-a-high-quality-picture-for-yourself"><a href="#Part2-Enhance-a-high-quality-picture-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Enhance a high quality picture for yourself"></a>Part2: Enhance a high quality picture for yourself</h2><p>Alternatively, you can take control and enhance a high quality picture for yourself. Developers offer stand-alone video and image editing software with amazing results. Below is some top-ranking software to consider when enhancing high quality pictures.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Photoshop-to-upscale-your-photos"><a href="#2-Use-Photoshop-to-upscale-your-photos" class="headerlink" title="2.

Both programs use AI resampling technology to increase your image quality and resolution. In addition, you get a free 7-day trial to test the software before purchasing one of its many subscription models.</p><p>Here is how to improve your image quality using Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.</p><ul><li>Right-click on the image file and select <strong>Lightroom</strong> as the run program.</li><li>Click on the photo to launch the menu, and click on <strong>Enhance</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Super Resolution</strong> as the output, and click <strong>Enhance</strong> to complete the process. The program automatically selects the best pixels to enhance, doubling your image size and quadrupling the pixel count.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, you can use the following steps when using Adobe Photoshop. Kindly note the software can enhance your image in the following ways.</p><p><strong>Adjust pixel dimensions</strong></p><ul><li>Launch Photoshop and select your image from the program library.</li><li>Select Image Size from the photo menu to launch the adjustment menu.</li><li>Enter the new image width and height values in the Dimensions section. Ensure you activate the chain icon to maintain your current width-to-height ratio.</li><li>Select Resample and click OK to complete the image adjustment.</li></ul><p><strong>Change Print Dimensions</strong></p><ul><li>Select the image you want to enhance from your Photoshop library.</li><li>Under the Image option, click on Image Size and deselect the Resample option. This ensures your image maintains its current width and height ratios.</li><li>You can change your image resolution by entering the new values into the Resolution and Document sections, then click Ok to finalize.</li></ul><p>Adobe Photoshop also allows you to adjust the image interpolation method when enhancing your high resolution background images for websites. Currently, Photoshop offers these image interpolation options:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Automatic</strong> option lets Photoshop determine the best resampling values based on the image type.</li><li><strong>Bicubic Smoother</strong> allows you to achieve smoother results after your image enhancement. In addition, the <strong>Bicubic Image Interpolation</strong> options address your image’s tonal gradations.</li><li>The <strong>Preserve Details</strong> option uses an advanced upscaling algorithm that allows you to apply Noise Reduction to your images.</li><li><strong>Nearest Neighbor</strong> is best for your Illustrations since it allows you to adjust the image’s hard edges and ensure no anti-aliasing.</li><li>Alternatively, you can increase your image’s pixel count by choosing the <strong>Bilinear</strong> Image Interpolation method. Photoshop averages the color values of surrounding pixels and uses the values to increase the pixel count.</li></ul><p>Finally, applying the Unsharp Mask filter is the secret to achieving even better image quality with Photoshop.</p><h2 id="Part3-FAQs"><a href="#Part3-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part3: FAQs"></a>Part3: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-Do-you-need-a-user-account-to-get-high-quality-pictures-for-free"><a href="#1-Do-you-need-a-user-account-to-get-high-quality-pictures-for-free" class="headerlink" title="1.
