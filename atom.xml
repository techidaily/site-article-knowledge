You can control photos as well as videos from a single button on the top - press it one time to capture stills and twice to record videos. One more button is available for Wi-Fi control that also assists in making connection with Cube+ application. You will find a Micro-USB slot and MicroSD card slot behind the door.</p><p> In case of GoPro Hero4 Session, you will not find any LCD screen on this device but you can view scenes on smart phone screen with app connectivity. On the top portion you will find a monochrome LCD panel that assists in easy setting for memory, battery, shooting modes as well as menu. Memory Card slot and USB connector is available besides the door. One LED on front and another on back keeps on indicating recording and wireless activities.</p><h4 id="2-Battery-and-Charging"><a href="#2-Battery-and-Charging" class="headerlink" title="2.Battery and Charging"></a>2.Battery and Charging</h4><p> The Lithium Ion battery of GoPro Hero Session can serve you up to 2 hours with 1080p recording at 30fps frame rate. If you keep your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on and capture 8MP photos once&#x2F;second then this battery will work up to 3 hour 35 minutes. For Cube+, the battery will serve you up to 1.5 hours even if you have Wi-Fi in ON position. You can charge its battery via Micro USB port using a simple USB power pack, computer or AC-USB Adapter.</p><h4 id="3-Waterproof"><a href="#3-Waterproof" class="headerlink" title="3.Waterproof"></a>3.Waterproof</h4><p> You can take GoPro Hero Session device under water up to 10 meter or 33 feet even without any additional protective housing.

For taking stills you can easily switch between 3MP, 6Mp and 8MP where automatic exposure effect leads to much impressive results in daylight. But in case of low light performance you may feel little disappointed. The image stabilization feature is a better addition for video modes.</p><p> There is no doubt to say that photo and video mode of Hero Session are impressive with outstanding audio quality. You can switch between various videos modes as: 1440p with 25&#x2F;30 fps, 1080p with 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;48&#x2F;50&#x2F;60fps, 960 with 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;50&#x2F;60 fps and 720p at 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;50&#x2F;60 and 100fps.

The settings panel is impressively improved with all streamlined arrangements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs.jpg"                      alt="OBS "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134489/18498" target="_top" id="2134489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134489/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-essential-steps-to-utilizing-azures-speech-to-text-service-effectively-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Steps to Utilizing Azure's Speech-to-Text Service Effectively for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-beyond-the-surface-what-you-dont-know-about-stories/"><u>[New] In 2024, Beyond the Surface What You Don't Know About Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-softening-volume-windowsmac-audio-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Softening Volume Windows/Mac Audio Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-attention-retention-on-youtube-with-these-6-tactics/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Art of Attention Retention on YouTube with These 6 Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/h-in-focus-building-a-foundation-of-youtube-backlinks/"><u>Growth in Focus Building a Foundation of YouTube Backlinks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/guide-to-extracting-srt-from-a-zip-archive/"><u>Guide to Extracting SRT From a ZIP Archive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-an-airtag-from-your-apple-id-account-on-iphone-15-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Remove an AirTag from Your Apple ID Account On iPhone 15?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-strategies-for-decoding-instagram-metrics-and-trends/"><u>In 2024, Expert Strategies for Decoding Instagram Metrics and Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-chroma-keying-in-fcp-x-tips-tricks-and-best-practices-for-2024/"><u>New Chroma Keying in FCP X Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/professional-workstations-elevated-with-amd-pro-8000-processor-family-and-integrated-npu-technology/"><u>Professional Workstations Elevated with AMD PRO 8000 Processor Family and Integrated NPU Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/slumber-screen-chronicles-evaluations-for-2024/"><u>Slumber Screen Chronicles Evaluations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-letdown-of-ps2-on-ps5-master-the-art-of-gaming-with-pcsx2-instead/"><u>The Letdown of PS2 on PS5: Master the Art of Gaming with PCSX2 Instead!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unveiling-the-Secrets-to-Premiere’s-Full-Screen-Mode"><a href="#Unveiling-the-Secrets-to-Premiere’s-Full-Screen-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Unveiling the Secrets to Premiere’s Full Screen Mode"></a>Unveiling the Secrets to Premiere’s Full Screen Mode</h2><p>Getting a full screen preview of your project is an important post-production step. This is because the default preview window of most editors can be too small to show all the flaws in your clips. For example, you may have missed a spot during the color correction, which you would have missed when using normal view. However, accessing the function varies with the software and your device’s operating system. Here is how to access premiere pro full screen preview from different devices.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-Do-Full-Screen-Preview-with-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part1-How-to-Do-Full-Screen-Preview-with-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?"></a>Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is one of a videographer’s best video editing software. This is because it offers you one of the largest libraries of creative and editing assets. Furthermore, you can work cross-platform through the Creative Clouds service.</p><p>Unfortunately, this becomes challenging for Windows and macOS users because of the operation difference between their devices. For example, the key names differ on each device’s keyboard. Windows Keyboards feature the CTRL key, and Apple offers the COMMAND key instead. As such, it is challenging to locate functions with HOTKEYS.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to access Premiere full screen preview on both devices.</p><h3 id="Windows-Users"><a href="#Windows-Users" class="headerlink" title="Windows Users"></a><strong>Windows Users</strong></h3><ol><li>Launch Adobe Premiere Pro from your device and open your project file.</li><li>Once all the clips load on their tracks, you begin editing with the suite of creative assets from the program library. Some of the edits you can do include applying color LUTS and green screen.</li><li>Then, tap the <strong>Play</strong> button or the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> key on your keyboard to preview your work.</li><li>To enable a large screen preview, press the Grave Key (represent by <strong>~</strong> on a Windows keyboard. Also it shares the key with `) to enlarge the preview window.</li><li>To activate Premier Pro full screen preview, just tab the same key while pressing Ctrl. In addition, the HOT KEY shortcut works with every video clip you want to preview.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-2.jpg"                      alt="tab the same key"                ></p><ol><li>Finally, you deactivate the function by pressing <strong>CTRL</strong> and <strong>~</strong> to return to the normal screen.</li></ol><h3 id="macOS-Users"><a href="#macOS-Users" class="headerlink" title="macOS Users"></a><strong>macOS Users</strong></h3><p>The process for macOS users is similar to the above. However, you will notice a difference in the HOT KEYS shortcuts.</p><ol><li>Launch the program and click on the Open Project option to access your project. Alternatively, you can directly access the program by clicking the project file on your storage device.</li><li>Then, select the clip you want to preview and hit the SPACEBAR to play the video. You can also activate play by clicking the Play button from your monitor panel.</li><li>To enable a full screen preview, simply <strong>press Control Key</strong> (represented by a ^ on the Mac keyboard) while tapping the <strong>Grave Key (represented by a ‘)</strong> on your keyboard to activate the Premiere full screen preview. In addition, you can deactivate it by hitting the combination again. It’s quite easy to reach with only the left hand.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Pro tips: If you still find the combination complex, here’s how to change it:</p><p>First, click “Premiere Pro” on the top menu, and choose Keyboard Shortcuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-4.jpg"                      alt="premiere pro"                ></p><p>Then, search for “Full” and you will see the defult shortcut. Click to change it to keys you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-5.jpg"                      alt="full"                ></p><p>Did you know you can also determine safe zone margins using Premiere Pro? These varying border lines on your Monitor Panel help you determine which objects are out of frame. Unfortunately, the feature is unavailable on previews or export files. Regardless, it is an extremely useful feature for your post-production. Follow these steps to enable it in your projects.</p><ul><li>Launch Premiere Pro on your device and import your clip to the Monitor Panel.</li><li>Select the clip you want to edit and right-click on the screen.</li><li>Enable the Safe Margins option by checking the box beside its name.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-What-If-Full-Screen-Preview-lags-heavily"><a href="#Part2-What-If-Full-Screen-Preview-lags-heavily" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What If Full Screen Preview lags heavily?"></a>Part2: What If Full Screen Preview lags heavily?</h2><p>So, you now know how to access Adobe Premiere Pro Full Screen Preview, but there is a problem. Your videos are not playing right, and you are wondering what to do. Here are a few solutions when you notice full screen preview is lagging</p><h3 id="1-Fix-your-video-rendering-and-playback-setting"><a href="#1-Fix-your-video-rendering-and-playback-setting" class="headerlink" title="1. Fix your video rendering and playback setting"></a>1. Fix your video rendering and playback setting</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is configured to utilize your device’s GPU for rendering. However, using the wrong video rendering and playback settings can cause your full screen preview to lag. Follow these steps to fix the problem.</p><ul><li>Tap on <strong>Project settings</strong> to open the settings menu.</li><li>Then, proceed to <strong>Renderer</strong> to view your current settings. You will find the option under video rendering and playback.</li><li>Choose your device’s GPU as the default option to activate GPU acceleration. In addition, you will need a compatible graphics processing unit to support this function.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136536/16384" target="_top" id="2136536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136536/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Uncheck-the-Mercury-Transmit-Feature"><a href="#2-Uncheck-the-Mercury-Transmit-Feature" class="headerlink" title="2. Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature"></a>2. Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature</h3><p>Another reason for full screen preview lag is Mercury Transmit. The feature allows you to transmit your video to a secondary screen. However, it takes up valuable RAM, especially when you do not own a second monitor. Here is how to disable it.</p><ul><li>Open your program settings and proceed to the <strong>Playback</strong></li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Enable Mercury Transmit</strong> option in the resulting menu.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Always-update-your-system-hardware-and-software"><a href="#3-Always-update-your-system-hardware-and-software" class="headerlink" title="3. Always update your system hardware and software"></a>3. Always update your system hardware and software</h3><p>Sometimes your full screen previews may lag because you miss the latest updates. Typically, developers provide users with free regular updates to make their software run better. For example, Adobe Premiere Pro issues regular updates to fix bugs and provide you with more creative library content.</p><p>As such, ensure you have the <strong>Check For Updates</strong> function enabled in your programs. Kindly note the feature only works if your device has an active internet connection.</p><h3 id="4-Play-the-video-at-a-lower-playback-resolution"><a href="#4-Play-the-video-at-a-lower-playback-resolution" class="headerlink" title="4. Play the video at a lower playback resolution"></a>4. Play the video at a lower playback resolution</h3><p>It is not wrong wanting to preview your video at 4K resolution. However, this can cause the program to lag significantly, especially if your device has low specs. In addition, changing your preview’s playback resolution does not affect its export settings. Follow these steps to make the changes:</p><ul><li>Access the <strong>Playback Resolution</strong> menu of your video clip from the <strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Then, alternate between lower values until the video lag stops. Currently, you can lower your Premiere full screen preview playback resolution up to 1&#x2F;16 the original value.</li></ul><h2 id="Part3-What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part3-What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part3: What’s the Best Alternative to Premiere Pro?"></a>Part3: What’s the Best Alternative to Premiere Pro?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-6.jpg"                      alt="best alternative to premiere pro"                ></p><p>So, you have given up on Premiere Pro’s persistent problems.

Most video editors apply video effects to their artwork for different purposes. Nowadays, videos without effects will probably cause a decrease in audience and supporters. To prevent that, editors keep seeking the best video effects for their videos.</p><p>There are many sources of video effects. Some are included in the video editing software, and you can find some on the internet. There are also video effects that can give a more realistic effect, which is probably a premium one, and you need to spend money to get that video effect in your hands. But if you don’t want to spend money seeking video effects, this article will significantly help you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/free-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="free video effects"                ></p><p>This composition will give you some information on how you will be able to download video effects without spending money.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">How does VFX differ from SFX?</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">When to use SFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">When to use VFX</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Get Free Video Effects?</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Pixabay.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Pexels.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mixkit.co</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Videezy.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Videvo.net</a></li></ol><h2 id="What-are-Video-Effects"><a href="#What-are-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Effects?"></a>What are Video Effects?</h2><p>The acronym VFX stands for video effects. The term “visual effects,” also known as “VFX,” refers to all types of digitally enhanced pictures, from adding backdrops using greenscreen to incorporating GGI models and entities. In filmmaking and video production, visual effects refer to how imagery is created or altered outside of a live-action shot.</p><h3 id="How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX"><a href="#How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX" class="headerlink" title="How does VFX differ from SFX?"></a>How does VFX differ from SFX?</h3><p>These concepts are frequently ambiguous; therefore, we wanted to examine this subject in greater detail to clarify any misunderstandings.</p><p>Usually, you can infer from the context which “kind” of VFX is being discussed. When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.</p><p>Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story’s narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?</p><h3 id="When-to-use-SFX"><a href="#When-to-use-SFX" class="headerlink" title="When to use SFX"></a>When to use SFX</h3><p>Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.</p><h3 id="When-to-use-VFX"><a href="#When-to-use-VFX" class="headerlink" title="When to use VFX"></a>When to use VFX</h3><p>Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?</p><p>It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.</p><p>Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not “behave” the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be “ordered” to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.</p><p>Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren’t always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Video Effects?"></a>How to Get Free Video Effects?</h2><p>Video effects are primarily included in your downloaded video editing software. But if you just downloaded a free video editing software, the video effects included are usually limited and sometimes superficial. Many video editing software offers premium video effects, which is undoubtedly not disappointing, but you have to spend money for a subscription to unlock all the features of that software.</p><p>This composition will show you how to get free video effects from different websites. Remember that it is free, so you should not expect more because, you know, the cooler and more realistic the video effect, the greater its value.</p><h3 id="1-Pixabay-com"><a href="#1-Pixabay-com" class="headerlink" title="1.

The term “visual effects,” also known as “VFX,” refers to all types of digitally enhanced pictures, from adding backdrops using greenscreen to incorporating GGI models and entities. In filmmaking and video production, visual effects refer to how imagery is created or altered outside of a live-action shot.</p><h3 id="How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX-1"><a href="#How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX-1" class="headerlink" title="How does VFX differ from SFX?"></a>How does VFX differ from SFX?</h3><p>These concepts are frequently ambiguous; therefore, we wanted to examine this subject in greater detail to clarify any misunderstandings.</p><p>Usually, you can infer from the context which “kind” of VFX is being discussed. When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.</p><p>Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story’s narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?</p><h3 id="When-to-use-SFX-1"><a href="#When-to-use-SFX-1" class="headerlink" title="When to use SFX"></a>When to use SFX</h3><p>Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014850/22899" target="_top" id="2014850">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014850" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014850/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="When-to-use-VFX-1"><a href="#When-to-use-VFX-1" class="headerlink" title="When to use VFX"></a>When to use VFX</h3><p>Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?</p><p>It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.</p><p>Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not “behave” the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be “ordered” to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.</p><p>Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren’t always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects-1"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Video Effects?"></a>How to Get Free Video Effects?</h2><p>Video effects are primarily included in your downloaded video editing software.

The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1. B roll In TV And Movies"></a>1. B roll In TV And Movies</h2><p>Broll is an acronym for “background” or “behind,” respectively. It usually refers to extra footage captured with a movie camera while keeping the lighting consistent between scenes in the movie industry. When the filmmaker doesn’t want to show any dialogue or action on screen but needs some movement within the frame, it might be utilized as filler.</p><p>B roll has been used from the first silent movies, including D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film “Intolerance.” Griffith’s creative application All of the shots that are used in a movie or television show are collectively referred to as “b roll footage.” To add context and complexity to the production being recorded, these shots are frequently seen on screen in quick succession.</p><p>B roll can be utilized for establishing shots as well as close-ups of items. It is used by filmmakers when they lack the funds for pricey films or when they want to showcase their originality. It’s also a fantastic method for narrating stories devoid of conversation. It might be anything, such a view of a landscape or a person’s hands holding up a sign with words on it.</p><p>For instance, wider shots are frequently used when someone is giving a speech while seated behind a podium so that we can see both them and their surroundings, such as audience members standing close and applauding or security personnel.</p><h2 id="2-Methods-to-use-b-roll"><a href="#2-Methods-to-use-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="2.

Most of the time, filmmakers don’t use B roll footage. One good way to use it is to use it as a way to move from one scene to the next. It can also be used to set the mood for an event or show what time of day it is when filming.</p><p>The ideal way to use B roll is to put it behind interviews. This kind of footage can be used in three ways: as establishing shots, cutaways, and transitions. Most of the time, the first few minutes of an interview or video help set the scene with “establishing shots.”</p><p>On the other hand, cutaways can show how different people react to what is being said in an interview. After all, transitions are commonly used to switch from one person’s experience with a certain topic to another person’s experience with the same topic. All of these different kinds of footage give filmmakers and videographers more freedom to tell their stories without relying too much on dialogue or narration.</p><h2 id="3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3.

But you didn’t have time to go through it, and you bookmarked it. Now, you came back to read it and, oh no…… It has been deleted for some reason.</p><p>No need to worry. You can see deleted Reddit posts in seconds. In fact, there are several simple methods to do this.</p><p>We’ll cover the best ones below and explain how to use each one.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Unddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Reveddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Resavr</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">The Wayback Machine</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Google Cache</a></li></ol><h2 id="5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts"><a href="#5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts"></a>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</h2><h3 id="1-Unddit"><a href="#1-Unddit" class="headerlink" title="1. Unddit"></a>1. Unddit</h3><p>Unddit is a third-party tool that uses Pushshift.io. This is a database that stores comments users leave on Reddit.</p><p>The main reason Unddit is so popular and used is because of its simplicity. It is easy to use the tool and takes about 10 seconds to set it all up. Let’s go over the steps to use Unddit and reveal some deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>Step1 First, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.unddit.com/" >Unddit.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step2 Click on the red “Unddit” button and drag it to your bookmark bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/red-unddit-button.png"                      alt="unddit button pointing to bookmark"                ></p><p>Step3 Go to the deleted Reddit post</p><p>Step4 Click on the Unddit bookmark you just saved</p><p>This will automatically lead you to a new page. There, Unddit analyses and displays all the deleted comments from that post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/unddit-results.png"                      alt="results page on unddit tool"                ></p><p>On the downside, Reddit doesn’t work well with most Reddit posts. It’s more effective for revealing deleted comments. Additionally, it may show an error from time to time. Unfortunately, the reason isn’t always displayed, and it’s something we need to live with.</p><h3 id="2-Reveddit"><a href="#2-Reveddit" class="headerlink" title="2. Reveddit"></a>2. Reveddit</h3><p>Unlike Unddit, Reveddit will always help you find deleted Reddit posts. It’s a powerful tool and much more stable compared to so many others out there.</p><p>This tool tracks Reddit activity in real-time. For example, you can use it to track deleted posts from specific users and subreddits. You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr"><a href="#3-Resavr" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature. There’s no way to search for a specific Reddit post. Instead, you can only view recent posts with deleted comments. Or you can type in a specific word and go through all the posts that pop up to find what you’re looking for.</p><h3 id="4-The-Wayback-Machine"><a href="#4-The-Wayback-Machine" class="headerlink" title="4. The Wayback Machine"></a>4. The Wayback Machine</h3><p>The Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that stores archives of other websites’ caches. It’s a non-profit site that lets you see deleted Reddit posts and comments that have been stored in the past.</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated to use, but it offers fantastic results. So, here’s what you need to do:</p><p>Step1 Visit archive.org. (Wayback Machine’s official website)</p><p>Step2 Paste the link to the deleted post and hit “Enter”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-bar.png"                      alt="wayback machine search bar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury" target="_top" id="2120863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Wayback Machine will display the results in a calendar format. Click on a date to see all deleted posts on that day in history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-results.png"                      alt="result page on wayback machine website"                ></p><p>Wayback Machine is a little slower when loading the results than other tools. But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><h3 id="5-Google-Cache"><a href="#5-Google-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky. Reddit doesn’t allow this, but it often gets overlooked, thanks to some of the tools we’ve discussed here. Even though it’s not permitted, sometimes we all want to read a post we saved a while ago.</p><p>Just remember, these tools can often stop working. This is because they don’t meet Reddit’s guidelines and run without the company’s permission. It’s not illegal or anything, but it just may crash and not display your desired results. Use them while you can and find deleted Reddit posts you want to check out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Unddit-1"><a href="#1-Unddit-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr-1"><a href="#3-Resavr-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature. There’s no way to search for a specific Reddit post. Instead, you can only view recent posts with deleted comments. Or you can type in a specific word and go through all the posts that pop up to find what you’re looking for.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424533">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424533">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424533%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424533/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Wayback-Machine-1"><a href="#4-The-Wayback-Machine-1" class="headerlink" title="4. The Wayback Machine"></a>4. The Wayback Machine</h3><p>The Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that stores archives of other websites’ caches. It’s a non-profit site that lets you see deleted Reddit posts and comments that have been stored in the past.</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated to use, but it offers fantastic results. So, here’s what you need to do:</p><p>Step1 Visit archive.org. (Wayback Machine’s official website)</p><p>Step2 Paste the link to the deleted post and hit “Enter”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-bar.png"                      alt="wayback machine search bar"                ></p><p>Step3 Wayback Machine will display the results in a calendar format. Click on a date to see all deleted posts on that day in history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-results.png"                      alt="result page on wayback machine website"                ></p><p>Wayback Machine is a little slower when loading the results than other tools. But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137206/26400" target="_top" id="2137206">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137206" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137206/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Google-Cache-1"><a href="#5-Google-Cache-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky. Reddit doesn’t allow this, but it often gets overlooked, thanks to some of the tools we’ve discussed here. Even though it’s not permitted, sometimes we all want to read a post we saved a while ago.</p><p>Just remember, these tools can often stop working. This is because they don’t meet Reddit’s guidelines and run without the company’s permission. It’s not illegal or anything, but it just may crash and not display your desired results. Use them while you can and find deleted Reddit posts you want to check out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-funny-carousel-image-builder/"><u>[New] In 2024, Funny Carousel Image Builder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-quantum-leap-in-photography-understanding-hdr/"><u>[New] In 2024, Quantum Leap in Photography Understanding HDR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlock-a-new-dimension-with-these-must-try-iphone-apps/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlock a New Dimension with These Must-Try iPhone Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-the-archivists-collection-essential-retro-visual-hacks-for-video-editors/"><u>[New] The Archivist's Collection Essential Retro Visual Hacks for Video Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-color-calibration-transitioning-from-traditional-rgb-to-srgb/"><u>[Updated] Color Calibration Transitioning From Traditional Rgb to Srgb</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-turn-standard-alerts-into-personalized-unique-sounds-on-android-devices/"><u>[Updated] Turn Standard Alerts Into Personalized, Unique Sounds on Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-realme-c53-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Realme C53 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-understanding-vr-headsets-an-overview/"><u>2024 Approved Understanding VR Headsets An Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/dynamic-games-best-flash-fueled-fun-for-phonespcs-for-2024/"><u>Dynamic Games Best Flash-Fueled Fun for Phones/PCs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/experience-the-best-of-broadcast-television-with-the-clearstream-eby-2v-hdtv-antenna-style-meets-functionality/"><u>Experience the Best of Broadcast Television with the ClearStream Eby 2V HDTV Antenna - Style Meets Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-phone-with-broken-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro Phone with Broken Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/perplexing-perspective-shifts-in-instagram-video-feeds/"><u>Perplexing Perspective Shifts in Instagram Video Feeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/resolved-how-to-fix-a-persistent-laptop-displaying-only-a-white-screen/"><u>Resolved: How to Fix a Persistent Laptop Displaying Only a White Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/stardew-valley-pc-crash-problem-easy-solutions-for-stable-gameplay/"><u>Stardew Valley PC Crash Problem: Easy Solutions for Stable Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-the-insiders-path-to-high-quality-unobtrusive-musical-pairings-for-media-creation/"><u>Updated The Insiders Path to High-Quality Unobtrusive Musical Pairings for Media Creation</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Though it may be a low-grade virtual reality, the thing is, it’s still VR. Google has a platform wherein you can open your android phone into a cut-rate VR viewer called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Google Cardboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The focus of this app is mostly put on games and experiences but it also empowers VR videos which are lightly immersed.</p><p>When your android phone has a VR viewer, you can have your own freedom of watching and looking around the world for 360-degree videos. Whether you’re watching an animated trippy clip, savoring a concert footage, watching stunts from all sides and angles; with VR viewer, it would feel like you’re actually among the crowd or in the place as the ones you’re watching. VR viewers like Google Cardboard makes the experience of watching videos less passive and creates new ways of visual storytelling.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">1.Choosing between VR and 360 Videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">2.Steps to Watch 360 Videos on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part3">3.Watching Local Videos on Android</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/google-cardbaorad-1.jpg"                      alt="google-cardbaorad-1"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Choosing-between-VR-and-360-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Choosing-between-VR-and-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choosing between VR and 360 Videos"></a>Part 1. Choosing between VR and 360 Videos</h2><p>The first distinction between VR and 360 Videos is that 360 videos can be watched and viewed with Cardboard and other VR handsets but 360 videos aren’t just like VR videos because VR videos with the right content has the depth of illusion.</p><p><strong>VR videos</strong> are stereoscopic 3D (has a different right and left eye point of view) which means these VR videos are providing added immersion by giving the sense of being on place in the world you’re watching such as nearby close-up objects while further items seem to off and far away. This only sounds like a very subtle difference between a 360 video and a VR video but in addition, the 3D quality is better used on VR handsets and can be justified by just placing your android phone up your eyes.</p><p>However, <strong>360 videos</strong> act mostly in the same manner. With the use of a phone’s gyroscope, it will let you look around as you take footage and they can still be viewed via VR viewer in good quality. Most cases show that non-VR video contents seem to be actually sharper when viewed on Cardboard. That’s why sometimes, depth is swapped with clarity whenever you choose between VR and 360 videos.</p><p>The higher frame rate and resolution of 360 videos and VR videos result to more pleasurable video experience especially via Cardboard. Videos with lower frame rate can actually add blurry artifacts which can then cause you to be a bit nauseous while watching the video. Nasty blurs can affect the focus of your eye that’s why you may feel nauseous. Opt for VR and 360 videos that have options of maximum quality when streaming. It’s okay if it needs more bandwidth. Just try finding the best versions and quality local videos whenever possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Watch-360-Videos-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Watch-360-Videos-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Steps to Watch 360 Videos on Android"></a>Part 2. Steps to Watch 360 Videos on Android</h2><p>Google Cardboard is letting you experience the fun and simple way into virtual reality. Through Google Cardboard and YouTube app on mobile android phones, the immersive experience of watching 360 videos is made possible.</p><ul><li>Have Google Cardboard and then assemble it.</li><li>Open your YouTube app on your mobile phone.</li><li>Proceed to the 360Video House Channel and search for “#360Video” and visit the channel. You’re in the right channel if you see this avatar.</li><li>Choose a video you want to play on the channel then start playback.</li><li>When you tap this Cardboard icon, the screen will split into two screens.</li><li>Insert your mobile phone into the Cardboard.</li><li>Look around and view your chosen video in 360 degrees.</li></ul><h5 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h5><p>In order to use Cardboard with your iOS devices, be sure to have iOS 9 or later.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Watching-Local-Videos-on-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Watching-Local-Videos-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Watching Local Videos on Android"></a>Part 3. Watching Local Videos on Android</h2><p>To watch local videos on your android phone, you can choose to download 360 video or VR video from a website that is compatible for your android device and software like Kolor eyes. You can easily play your local video files on your android phones as long as you have the right VR or 360 video app that will make your video experience even better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-10-free-downloads-legal-meditation-melodies/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Best 10 Free Downloads Legal Meditation Melodies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-of-kung-fu-video-games/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate List of Kung Fu Video Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-demystifying-spotify-advertising-for-marketers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Demystifying Spotify Advertising for Marketers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-investigating-freezing-moments-in-photobooth-recordings/"><u>2024 Approved Investigating Freezing Moments in Photobooth Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-track-nokia-105-classic-without-app-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Ways to Track Nokia 105 Classic without App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/direct-methods-save-instagram-reels-without-relying-on-additional-applications/"><u>Direct Methods: Save Instagram Reels without Relying on Additional Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-changeadd-location-filters-on-snapchat-for-your-vivo-t2x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change/Add Location Filters on Snapchat For your Vivo T2x 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-art-of-low-volume-playback-system-guide/"><u>In 2024, The Art of Low-Volume Playback System Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/strategies-to-extend-windows-11-shutdown-process/"><u>Strategies to Extend Windows 11 Shutdown Process</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/top-practices-in-producing-trustworthy-video-product-reviews/"><u>Top Practices in Producing Trustworthy Video Product Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/transformative-conversion-tracking-powered-by-the-innovations-of-cookiebot/"><u>Transformative Conversion Tracking Powered by the Innovations of Cookiebot</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-best-zero-cost-image-editors-online/"><u>Ultimate Guide Best Zero-Cost Image Editors Online</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135356/19272" target="_top" id="2135356">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135356" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135356/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

In fact, the newest innovation is 360° video and although they both sound like the same technology, they are actually quite different.</p><h2 id="The-Differences-Between-VR-Video-and-360°-Video"><a href="#The-Differences-Between-VR-Video-and-360°-Video" class="headerlink" title="The Differences Between VR Video and 360° Video"></a>The Differences Between VR Video and 360° Video</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/difference-between-vr-360-video.jpg"                      alt="difference between 360 video and VR"                ></p><h3 id="Photography"><a href="#Photography" class="headerlink" title="Photography"></a>Photography</h3><p> When it comes to looking at the photography of both mediums, that is where you’ll see the most significant differences between both VR video and 360° video. In a virtual reality environment, the photography is created digitally, as mentioned it is referred to as a virtual environment, or VE. A team of professionals creates these landscapes, characters, and elements typically within a digital studio and with the help of computers and software programs.</p><p> In comparison, 360° video is captured from a real-life landscape. These live action videos are not reconstructions of things that you would see in your everyday life, they are real videos in real places that everyone has access to.</p><h3 id="Mobility"><a href="#Mobility" class="headerlink" title="Mobility"></a>Mobility</h3><p> It’s also interesting to consider the amount of mobility that viewers have when it comes to both types of video, as virtual reality is far more immersive than 360° video. With virtual reality the viewer or player has the ability to walk relatively anywhere and explore further into the landscape. The only thing that may prevent you from venturing too far is if you are tethered to a computer or any other device that is providing you with the artificial landscape. Otherwise, you can easily walk absolutely anywhere while you are immersed in the world.</p><p> On the other side, a 360° video only gives you a certain amount of viewing power. Since the filmmaker will have full control over the content that you see, viewers will only have the ability to get a full view of what the filmmaker has filmed. The movements of the filmmaker limit the entire viewing field.</p><h3 id="Timeline"><a href="#Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Timeline"></a>Timeline</h3><p> One of the main reasons as to why VR video is so popular amongst video game studios is because they can integrate a vast timeline to keep their players entertained. With virtual reality the timeline could be endless as you can create a series of events or different experiences that exist in a theoretical world. The way that the timeline progresses depends on the actions of the user, whereas with 360° video, the timeline progresses based on what the filmmaker has filmed.</p><h3 id="Platform"><a href="#Platform" class="headerlink" title="Platform"></a>Platform</h3><p> When you consider the platforms that are available for both mediums, it can be more cost effective to use 360° video as users can access the video from any device that offers viewing capabilities and that is compatible with 360° videos. For example, they can log onto their computers and visit free websites such as YouTube to watch the video. With virtual reality you have to purchase particular accessories that support the program you’re involved in. Typically these can be quite expensive; Sony is releasing a VR headset for approximately the same price as an entire console.</p><h3 id="Content-Story"><a href="#Content-Story" class="headerlink" title="Content&#x2F;Story"></a>Content&#x2F;Story</h3><p> Creating the content and the story for VR is far more in-depth than 360° simply because the filmmaker doesn’t have control over what the viewer sees. You have to ensure that every crevice is designed perfectly to capture the attention of the audience and to impress them. You also have to pay special attention to enticing them to want to immerse themselves more in the environment. It’s equally as important to capture the attention of the viewer with 360° video, though you have full control of what your viewers can see.</p><p> Overall, both technologies are interesting and have shaped the way that we view content on a regular basis. Virtual reality seems to be a more in-depth technology that allows players to explore a brand new universe, whereas 360° video is great for real-life applications.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129042/19576" target="_top" id="2129042">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129042" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129042/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-Virtual-Reality-video"><a href="#What-is-Virtual-Reality-video" class="headerlink" title="What is Virtual Reality video?"></a>What is <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/what-is-vr-video.html" >Virtual Reality video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</h2><p> Virtual Reality videois something that has been discussed everywhere from sci-fi films to video games all over the world. With VR video you are given the ability to immerse yourself in a specific scene that has been created by an animator. It is essentially a way to allow the user to explore a virtual environment in real-time. In comparison to a 360° video, virtual reality is like it name suggests, a reality that has been virtually created for your exploration.</p><h2 id="What-is-360°-Video"><a href="#What-is-360°-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is 360° Video?"></a>What is <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/what-is-360-video.html" >360° Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</h2><p> If you’re a fan of major YouTube personalities, you’ve undoubtedly seen 360° video before as companies have been developing innovations that allow people to record their daily lives with a 360° view.

So iON Air Pro can be rated as a good choice for surfing needs but when it comes to diving then you have to look at GoPro.<br> The package includes decent accessories such as universal power adapter, USB cable and mounts. Even if you want to buy few additional accessories then they can be obtained with much cheaper price tag as compared to GoPro collections. The mount upgrade options include surfboards, handle bars and headbands. On the front side you will find a f2.8 fog free lens with 16 mm dimensions.</li><li><strong>Video and Photo Quality:</strong><br> The iON Air Pro 3 device can serve users with 1080p resolution level at 30 fps frame rate settings. The maximum supported bit rate with this mode is 12 Mbps. You can easily switch to 720p with 120 fps, 30fps and 60 fps frame rate settings where bit rate increases up to 22 Mbps. The best thing to know is its ability to record a secondary thumbnail at WQVGA resolution level during 1080p resolution setting, this file can be easily uploaded on internet and can be shared immediately with other devices. In case if you are working with remote application then supported resolution settings are 720p&#x2F;30fps and 1080p&#x2F; 30 fps, the mode gets automatically selected depending upon resolution switch position. Videos can be easily captured at 160 degree wide angle type view. Further, it can be adjusted to obtain little tighter details with 140 and 150 degree focus. This fixed focus type lens is best from 3.3 feet and ranges perfectly up to infinity thus you need to maintain proper space between subject and camera.<br> It can capture stills at 12Mp and 5MP resolution level while serving with 4:3 aspect ratio. Users can prefer to switch between time lapse and burst modes with interval selection of 60, 30. 10, 5 and 2 for the first case and 10 shot type settings in case of burst mode.</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi and Application:</strong><br> It is much simpler to access Wi-Fi settings with this device. Switch on your device as well as the Wi-Fi Podz then move to Wi-Fi setting of your tablet or smart phone. Here also select Podz from your network and then add password. The settings part is over and now you can control your device from remote location easily.

But the good news is that this non removable battery makes it a compact action camera with waterproof body so that it can be easily used in tough situations. With 1080p resolution level it can record easily up to 2.5 hours. On the other side, the supported Micro SD card goes up to 64 GB capacity. Thus you can easily store a shoot of 4 hours 20 minute length if working on 1080p at 60 fps rating. Additionally, you will be able to obtain 8GB additional space from MiMedia that can be easily used for sharing videos or photos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p> This bullet shaped camera is right option for you if you are searching for something having features close to Toshiba or GoPro designs. The Wi-Fi PODZ adds flexibility to controls and accessibility. As the box include only few basic mounts so you may have to spend little extra to get the remaining ones from market. This device is best rated for helmet mount needs. The excellent video quality along with ease of operation and wide angle focus make it first choice under affordable action cam model category. You don’t need to spend on a waterproof case but apps are yet to be improved to enhance flexibility.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premium-timekeeping-for-your-nuptials-appleandroid-selection/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Premium Timekeeping For Your Nuptials Apple/Android Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unparalleled-screenplay-craftsmanship-across-varied-fields/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unparalleled Screenplay Craftsmanship Across Varied Fields</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-laughter-unleashed-a-stepwise-strategy-for-making-impactful-gifs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Laughter Unleashed A Stepwise Strategy for Making Impactful GIFs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-androids-premier-8-apps-harmonizing-free-and-paid-videomosaic-experience/"><u>[Updated] Android's Premier 8 Apps Harmonizing Free & Paid Videomosaic Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unravel-the-mystery-of-tempo-control-in-instagram-stories/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unravel the Mystery of Tempo Control in Instagram Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-quick-start-guide-to-editing-with-snapseed-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Quick Start Guide to Editing with Snapseed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/beyond-free-to-play-uncover-the-top-5-mobile-game-advantages/"><u>Beyond 'Free-to-Play': Uncover the Top 5 Mobile Game Advantages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/cumulative-community-capture-for-2024/"><u>Cumulative Community Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-and-where-to-find-a-shiny-stone-pokemon-for-honor-x9b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How and Where to Find a Shiny Stone Pokémon For Honor X9b? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12t-pro-like-a-pro-5-easy-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Like A Pro 5 Easy Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/mastery-of-podcast-rss-feeds-a-step-by-step-tutorial-for-2024/"><u>Mastery of Podcast RSS Feeds A Step-by-Step Tutorial for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-5-best-free-video-rotation-apps-for-iphone-users/"><u>New 2024 Approved 5 Best Free Video Rotation Apps for iPhone Users</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Well, no need to waste your energy. The iPhone camera offers just the perfect feature to counter this problem - the HDR feature.</p><p>Most people have to use photo editing software to fix the exposures of photos, but luckily for us, we don’t need that.</p><p>In this article, we will give you a brief overview of HDR photography and then guide you on how to shoot HDR photos with an iPhone.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?</h2><p>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range, and it refers to a photography technique where multiple exposures of a scene are combined to create one well-lit picture. It captures a scene’s darkest and lightest tone and shows them as such in the final photo.</p><p>Apple introduced the HDR feature back in 2010 on iPhone 4. It was a breakthrough for the company, further enhancing the iPhone camera. Since then, all the succeeding models of the iPhone have the HDR feature.</p><p>However, Apple has advanced its HDR technology with the passage of time. Before the release of the iPhone 12, Apple worked with HDR10. With the iPhone 12, Apple inculcated Dolby Vision HDR, becoming the first to roll out Dolby Vision in a mobile handset.</p><p>Without the HDR feature, your iPhone camera is not capable of capturing a high-contrast scene. This will lead you to having exposure problems in your pictures.</p><p>Your scene might have dark tones that are well exposed with the right colors and details, but the bright areas might be over-exposed with no shade or detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot"                ></p><p>On the other hand, your scene might have bright tones that are well-exposed with the right color and details, but the dark areas are too dark to show the details.</p><p>Alt text: HDR shoot with different exposure</p><p>With the iPhone’s HDR feature, you can get a perfectly exposed photo showing details simultaneously in light and dark tones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot with different exposure"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?"></a>Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?</h2><p>Now that we know how HDR helps make our pictures pop out, let’s look at how you can take an HDR photo with your iPhone camera.</p><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?"></a>How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?</h3><p>Here is a step-by-step guide for you to follow. This guide is applicable for iPhone XS, iPhone XR, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>The first step for you is to go to your iPhone Settings. Here, click on the Camera app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="go to settings and click on camera"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Adjust-the-Settings"><a href="#Step2Adjust-the-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step2Adjust the Settings"></a>Step2Adjust the Settings</h5><p>Here, ensure that the Smart HDR (or Auto HDR in iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X) is toggled off. The HDR option will not be available in the camera if you do not switch this off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="turn on smart hdr"                ></p><p>Also, ensure that the “Keep Normal Photo” toggle is on. Having this enabled will let your camera save a non-HDR version of the photo as well as the HDR version.</p><h5 id="Step3Head-to-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Step3Head-to-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Step3Head to the Camera App"></a>Step3Head to the Camera App</h5><p>Once you have adjusted the setting, open the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step4Enable-HDR"><a href="#Step4Enable-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Step4Enable HDR"></a>Step4Enable HDR</h5><p>At the top of the screen, you will see an HDR option. Tap on it to enable (or disable) it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="go the camera and click on hrd from top menu"                ></p><p>In older iPhones such as iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and earlier, you have the option to set it to Auto, On, or Off. Choose the “On” option.</p><p>You can now take HDR photos with your iPhone!</p><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-Photos-on-iPhone-13"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-Photos-on-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR Photos on iPhone 13?"></a>How to take HDR Photos on iPhone 13?</h3><p>In the iPhone 13 models, the steps for taking an HDR photo are slightly different. The first few steps are the same. Go to Settings &gt; Camera. Under the HDR section, find the “HDR” option and turn the toggle on.</p><p>Once the toggle is on, go to the Camera app. You will see the HDR option where you can turn it On&#x2F;Off or set it to Automatic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123469/16836" target="_top" id="2123469">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123469" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123469/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?</h2><p>You may notice that when you shoot photos with HDR on your iPhone, your camera roll shows two identical pictures. This happens when the “Keep Normal Photo” setting is enabled in the iPhone Camera Settings. This setting is only available on iPhone X and earlier.</p><p>For the latest versions, you can only see the Smart HDR option. By default, Smart HDR does not save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><p>The “Keep Normal Photo” option is helpful in instances where you might have to compare the HDR and non-HDR versions. You may even prefer the non-HDR version in some cases.</p><p>But the side effect of this feature is that it becomes a nuisance to delete the other versions, and it also takes up space.</p><p>Here is how you can disable this setting and avoid having two same photos.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings-1"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>Go to your iPhone Settings and tap on the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option"><a href="#Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option"></a>Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option</h5><p>You will see a “Keep Normal Photo” toggle in the HDR panel. Turn the toggle off.</p><p>Once the toggle is off, you can go and take an HDR photo. The camera app will no longer save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?"></a>Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?</h2><p>The iPhone’s HDR option enables you to get great shots. Apple introduced a “Smart HDR” option on iPhone where the camera shoots photos in HDR (when necessary) by default. This option ensures that users don’t have to go to great lengths to get amazing shots.</p><p>However, there may be instances when you feel that the “Smart HDR” option is not working.</p><h3 id="Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App"></a><strong>Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App</strong></h3><p>There may be a case where you open your Camera app to take a picture in HDR but there is no HDR option available to you. This is usually the case with iPhone 13 models, and its pro variants.</p><p>Well, the reason behind it is that Apple has added a new feature in these models that the Camera is set to capture HDR shots by default. So, users do not have the option to control the HDR feature.</p><p>It certainly takes away the control that users had in their shots because not all HDR images turn out to be perfect. Especially while zooming into things, the images start looking like a painting. However, it works just fine in most cases.</p><h3 id="Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max"></a><strong>Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max</strong></h3><p>Certain iPhone XS Max users are facing a problem where the Photos app does not show whether the image is an HDR image or not. Previously, users could see an “HDR” tag on their photos. However, recently the tags are not visible anymore.</p><p>Worry not, this does not mean that your Smart HDR is not working. You can check this by disabling Smart HDR from Settings &gt; Camera. Once Smart HDR is disabled, go to the Camera app and take a picture without HDR. Compare the before and after images to see if your HDR feature is working or not.</p><p>Such instances of Smart HDR may occur but you don’t need to worry too much about them. The simple solutions mentioned above will surely fix your problem. In case they don’t help, you can contact the Apple Support to get your queries resolved.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device"><a href="#Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device"></a>Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device</h2><p>HDR photography is a really cool technique that can really make your content more appealing.

What better way to do that than Photoshop?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Adobe is a premium-level image and graphics editor. Photoshop has held the gold standard for editing graphics and images for years. It is undoubtedly the best photo background editor app you can find to get your job done. With its precise tools and a sleek interface, it is relatively easy to insert your photo and edit background image.</p><p>Here is how you can edit and replace your image background in Photoshop:</p><p>Step 1: Select your Subject</p><p>Add your image to the interface of the program. From the toolbar on the left, tap the “Quick Selection” tool. Now drag the area of the image you want to select using the brush. You can hold the “Alt” key and drag the unwanted areas to remove them from the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-1.jpg"                      alt="use quick selection tool"                ></p><p>Step 2: Mask your Selection</p><p>Go to the options bar present at the top. Tap on “Select and Mask” to convert your selection into a mask. From the “Properties” panel, tap “View Mode” to determine how you want to see your selection. “Overlay” works best in general.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-2.jpg"                      alt="select the view mode"                ></p><p>Step 3: Polish the Edges</p><p>You can now further refine your selected part using the different tools offered by Photoshop. Use the “Quick Selection” tool to add or remove large areas. For hair and soft edges, you can use the “Refine Edge Brush” tool. The “Lasso&#x2F;Polygonal Lasso” tool can help manually draw areas for your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-3.jpg"                      alt="edit the image edges"                ></p><p>Step 4: Remove Residual Colors</p><p>From the panel at the right, select “Output Settings.” Check the box next to “Decontaminate Colors” to get rid of any leftover color fringe from your foreground. From “Output,” you now need to add a new layer by clicking on “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-4.jpg"                      alt="remove the selected color"                ></p><p>Step 5: Add a New Background</p><p>You can now paste the image you wish to add as a background for your photo. Position your image on the layer below the one with your foreground. You can resize your background image if required by selecting the “Free Transform” tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-5.jpg"                      alt=" add new picture background"                ></p><p>Step 6: Fix the Colors</p><p>To blend the colors of your two images, select your foreground layer. Now go to “Image” and open “Adjustments.” From here, launch the “Match Color” popup window. Navigate to “Source” and select your image. From the “Layer” option, choose the layer you want to fix.</p><p>Tick the “Neutralize” box and adjust the “Luminance” and “Intensity” until you meet your requirements. You are all done now! Click “OK” and save your newly edited image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-6.jpg"                      alt="fix the image colors"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?"></a>Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?</h2><p>A blurred background helps bring your image into focus. If you want a photo editor to blur background of your image, you can try Photoshop. Here are the steps for that:</p><p>Step 1: Isolate Subject</p><p>Isolate your subject on a separate layer by accessing the “Quick Selection” tool and clicking on the “Select Subject” button. You can use the “Lasso” tool to refine your selection. Click on “Select and Mask” and select the “Black and White View.” Now, choose the output to “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-7.jpg"                      alt="change the output"                ></p><p>Step 2: Expand the Selection</p><p>Hold the “CTRL” key and select your layer mask. Go to the “Select” tab, find and expand “Modify,” and tap “Expand.” Select a suitable number and tap “OK” Next, go to the “Edit” tab and select “Content-Aware Fill.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-8.jpg"                      alt="expand selection by pixels"                ></p><p>Step 3: Apply Photo Blur</p><p>Right-click on the background layer and choose “Convert to Smart Object.” Head over to the “Filter” tab, expand “Blur Gallery,” and choose “Tilt-Shift.” You can change the field lines to adjust the depth of field for your image and create a smooth transition. You can also control the intensity of the blur from the slider present on the right. Click “OK” and save your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-9.jpg"                      alt="confirm blur settings"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Photo-Background"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Photo-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Photo Background?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Photo Background?</h2><p>Want to remove the background from your image? Photoshop offers a photo-cut background solution for that. You can try that by following the steps below:</p><p>Step 1: Remove Background</p><p>To start with, insert your image and go to the Properties window. Under “Quick Options,” click on the “Remove Background” option. Photoshop will automatically detect your subject and remove the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-10.jpg"                      alt="tap on remove background"                ></p><p>Step 2: Refine Outline</p><p>To fix any mistake in your selection, go to the “Select” tab and click “Select and Mask.” From the toolbar, choose the “Quick Selection” tool. You can use the minus sign to get rid of the extra background or the plus sign to bring back the background. Click on “OK” and save your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-11.jpg"                      alt="remove remaining backgroud"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-3-Best-Websites-to-Download-Stunning-Photo-Editing-Background-Images"><a href="#Part-4-3-Best-Websites-to-Download-Stunning-Photo-Editing-Background-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 3 Best Websites to Download Stunning Photo Editing Background Images"></a>Part 4: 3 Best Websites to Download Stunning Photo Editing Background Images</h2><p>Looking for a suitable background for your image?

What better way to do that than Photoshop?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Adobe is a premium-level image and graphics editor. Photoshop has held the gold standard for editing graphics and images for years. It is undoubtedly the best photo background editor app you can find to get your job done. With its precise tools and a sleek interface, it is relatively easy to insert your photo and edit background image.</p><p>Here is how you can edit and replace your image background in Photoshop:</p><p>Step 1: Select your Subject</p><p>Add your image to the interface of the program. From the toolbar on the left, tap the “Quick Selection” tool. Now drag the area of the image you want to select using the brush. You can hold the “Alt” key and drag the unwanted areas to remove them from the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-1.jpg"                      alt="use quick selection tool"                ></p><p>Step 2: Mask your Selection</p><p>Go to the options bar present at the top. Tap on “Select and Mask” to convert your selection into a mask. From the “Properties” panel, tap “View Mode” to determine how you want to see your selection. “Overlay” works best in general.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-2.jpg"                      alt="select the view mode"                ></p><p>Step 3: Polish the Edges</p><p>You can now further refine your selected part using the different tools offered by Photoshop. Use the “Quick Selection” tool to add or remove large areas. For hair and soft edges, you can use the “Refine Edge Brush” tool. The “Lasso&#x2F;Polygonal Lasso” tool can help manually draw areas for your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-3.jpg"                      alt="edit the image edges"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 4: Remove Residual Colors</p><p>From the panel at the right, select “Output Settings.” Check the box next to “Decontaminate Colors” to get rid of any leftover color fringe from your foreground.
