Skype was created to make it possible for individuals to interact with one another for free, no matter where they are. By installing the app on your smartphone and making an account, you can access the app. Unless you wish to contact them on their landline or cellphone, in which case you may purchase a premium membership, Skype is free.

Whether you started the call or are only a participant, you may start it as long as you have the link. Once you have a link, you may use it whenever you wish to join the conversation. Links can be used again in the future.
