## Part 1: GoPro Video Editing App for Android

### 1.Quik

This is one of the most convenient and easy to use app in GoPro's arsenal. Quik is a free application that would automatically create nicely edited videos within just a few minute's time. The editing process is as simple as it can possibly get; all you have to do is selecting the videos or pictures which you would like to show in the movie from the library and Quik is going to do the rest. However, you can only use the images and videos which are stored in your phone's library. You can also mix the GoPro footage with those of your phones if you want.

![gopro editing apps Quik](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quik-gopro.jpeg)

### 2.Antix

Antix is a special kind of application that makes use of the motion sensors of your smartphone in order to detect when some exciting action is happening. However, the app developers still haven’t revealed what exactly is deemed exciting by this app. It would recommend the key scenes by a comparison of the recorded motion footage from your phone with the help of the video stream of your GoPro.

![best gopro app Antix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Antix.jpg)

### 3. KineMaster

This video editor is multiple timeline editing. The slow-motion editor can empower the details of your exciting moments, which means viewers can have more engagement with your GoPro videos. The power of this app derives from an algorithm that would help you to find the most exciting snippets from your recordings and edit them promptly into shareable bits. You can also choose to add any background sound to your video wither from the mic of your phone or from a preselected list of licensed tracks.
