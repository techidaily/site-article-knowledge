## 4.[End space VR](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/end-space-vr-for-cardboard/id1056999701?mt=8)

End space is a shooter that is built specifically for use with VR.

Players can upgrade their ship as well as enjoy a never ending horde of harder ships to face off with them in space combat. There are plenty of upgrades for the ships and great sound with this game but with never ending style gameplay it does get old quite quickly.
