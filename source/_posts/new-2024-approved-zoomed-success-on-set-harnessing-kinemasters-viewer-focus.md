You can tap on the pan and zoom option in the panel on the right side. When activated, the pan and zoom tool will display a picture of the media on the right.

Now you can see how to zoom in/out videos on Kinemaster. You can practice it on your own to get a precise idea of how to zoom in and out. You can use Kinemaster for several video editing options and contact good video editors other than Kinemaster, such as Quik, and Vieka. These are the alternative options to use for video editing apart from Kinemaster.
