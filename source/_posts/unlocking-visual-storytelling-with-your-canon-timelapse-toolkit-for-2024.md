**2:-** Tap on the info button to access the setting for the interval time and the no. of shots.

**3:-** You can choose the interval number to determine your camera's frequency, which means once every second or twice a minute. The interval time will depend on the subject.

According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.

**5:-** Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.

## Part 3\. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips

**Never forget to take test shots:-** You must never start shooting straight away. Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.

**Always take photos in JPG:-** Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.

**Use manual mode:-** It's recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.

**Carry extra batteries:-** If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries. Also, it is good if the camera battery is changed before your camera gets shut down. If you are shooting time-lapse video indoors, it's better to use the main charger. Also, it will help you avoid excess battery draining.

**Carry Extra Memory cards:-** You will never want to run out of space while making a time-lapse, and you will have to make the calculations according to your time-lapse. Also, make sure you carry the extra memory cards to be prepared.

**Choose the best spot:-** Set your tripod securely and in a place where it cannot be knocked or moved quickly.

**Focus on the camera:-** Always ensure that the equipment and camera are in sight while you are shooting and safe.
