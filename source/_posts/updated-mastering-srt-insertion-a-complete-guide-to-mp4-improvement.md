## Final Words

Gone are the days when adding SRT to MP4 was considered a very difficult task. Now, you can add subtitles to as many MP4 videos as you want easily without requiring any technical knowledge. All you need is advanced software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or an online tool like Clideo. Irrespective of the tool you're looking to use, we advise you follow the steps explained on this page correctly. However, we recommend using Filmora for a more efficient SRT to MP4 conversion.
