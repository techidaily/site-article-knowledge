### Features on Filmora Teachers Could Use to Improve Educational Videos

**Text to Speech**

**Screen Recorder**

One example is when teaching students how blood circulates. How does blood enter the heart, and how does it exit it? You can screen record a video of you explaining that through drawing arrows in an app.

**Split Screen**
