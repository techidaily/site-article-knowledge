## First Impression of LG 360 VR

### Design of LG 360 VR

 The 360 VR does not look like other headsets present in the market and in this occurrence, this is not a good feature. Certainly, it is tough, maybe terrible even, to make someone look cool while having a VR headset on their head. But with the design of 360 VR, it is quite sure that engineers have made no attempt to resolve this issue. The headset sports a look similar to what common in the 1980s imagined a futuristic invention would look like. It actually looks like a product with a low-cost, NHS-prescribed article for modifying poor vision.

### Accessories of LG 360 VR

 Since it is connected via USB Type-C connector, so the company provides it with the package. The adjustable lenses and their covers are present. A 3.5 mm jack is also present on the headset for the headphones which are also provided. Well, many other necessary things are also provided with.

### Product Packaging of LG 360 VR

 Well, the packaging is quite simple as all the other products of LG. It comes in a simple box will all the accessories in it. It is okay to say that the packaging is safe, but should be dealt with care, in the end, it is a delicate product. Everything looks good until it is inside the box.

### How to Set up LG 360 VR headset

* First of all, connect the USB connector of the headset on to your smartphone. It will take a few minutes. When the headset is on, the screen of your phone will become off, and now you can use your phone as a touchpad.
* The headset will not work normally when it is connected to the LG G5 phone if you have connected LG Hi-Fi plus, LG CAM Plus or any other device that is not of the G5 module.
* The LG 360 VR turns off if your phone remains idle without playing any video or application for a minimum of 15 minutes in order to save the battery of your phone.
* Other than that, the headset will connect to the phone if the battery of your phone is too low or the phone is too hot.

### LG 360 VR Performance

 When you ponder that it is the LG G5 phone that is actually doing all the work in terms of actually driving the 360 VR's practices, you would at least assume steady performance. We know that the G5 is one of the most influential smartphones present in the market, including an Adreno 530 GPU, Snapdragon 820 and a 4GB RAM. Unfortunately, the first experience with the 360 VR’s performance is unsatisfactory to say the minimum. Having a 920 x 720 resolution per eye, this headset provides a much lower resolution rate as compared to all other virtual reality headsets present in the market. Although using it is a rollercoaster ride through various mixed experiences.

### More about LG 360 VR headset

 LG 360 VR is a virtual reality device designed by LG. It was actually released with LG G5 and used to promote this phone. LG 360 VR has an internal built-in display, unlike the Gear VR designed by Samsung, which also provides a unit plugging for power directly to the phone. The headset can be controlled from the smartphone screen by just tapping and swiping. LG, however, designed this device to enjoy the virtual reality experience, but the device is not up to the mark. If you haven’t bought this device yet, it is highly advised not to buy this one. It is not a very good design and its performance is also not very good.

 However, with a cost of around $200 to $220, LG 360 VR is a very expensive device with a doubly cost of Samsung Gear VR. In addition to that, it only is compatible with LG G5\. Now, it was better if, with this price and compatibility of just one, 360 VR provided a better experience, but it is not a good device to use.

 In crux, LG’s this device isn't somewhat you'd want to attire in public, and when you ponder that one of the assistances of a mobile headset is that you are not tied to a luxurious gaming rig, LG certainly should have put in some more energy when it comes to the design of 360 VR. If we are going to turn out to be a realm of VR zombies with headsets continually tied to our skulls, then we would probably want those units which let us live in style.
