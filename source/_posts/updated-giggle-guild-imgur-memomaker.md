## Giggle Guild: Imgur MemoMaker

Memes are the photos or videos that are posted through social media handles for fun and entertainment. They have been a constant attraction for netizens across the world and in recent times their popularity has risen a lot. Also, with such a constant demand for trendy memes across social media, the applications used to generate memes are also in high demand. Imgur meme generator is one such meme-creating platform that is very easy to use and has all the trending as well as famous meme templates.

These templates are ready to use and they can be edited as per the preference of the users. Another thing that sets Imgur apart from other similar meme-generating platforms is that it provides free texts and fonts as well as meme tracks to add to the meme instantly.

## Part 1\. How to create a meme with Imgur online?

Often the meme creators are required to generate memes instantaneously with a new trend and in such situations, installing a meme generator on the device and then editing and creating a meme is very ineffective. To solve this issue, you can use the Imgur meme maker which is an online platform that lets users create memes on the go. There are plenty of categorized meme templates available in this web app and you also get a search bar for searching the trendy meme template. And if you want to edit your meme and post it on any social media, then Imgur is the best choice. You can follow these steps to create a meme with Imgur online:

* First, open the official website of Imgur, and then in the website interface, you will see the option to create a new post.

![open imgur website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-imgur-website.jpg)

* Click on that and then select "Select a default meme" to set the default meme template for editing. Alternatively, you can also click on "Upload new background" to add your image template for generating a meme.

* There is also a "search tool" where you can find any specific meme according to its keywords. And below it, there is the option for "Browse memes" where you can select meme templates from thousands of memes categorized on the website.

* After you are done with the changes, click on the "make this meme" option and the meme will be saved to your device after it gets downloaded successfully.

## Part 2\. How to use Imgur on iPhone and iPad?

As discussed earlier, Imgur is one of the most efficient ways of creating memes through its online platform. But if you are an iPhone or iPad user, then you must be wondering how you can use Imgur on your device for free.

Well, Imgur is also available on iPhones and iPad and it is completely free to use which means you will be able to edit and post your favorite memes on the go. Like all other Imgur users, you also have access to thousands of meme templates available on Imgur. The complete process to use Imgur on iPhone or iPad to generate memes is as follows:

* First, go to the app store and download the official Imgur application to your device. After it is downloaded, open it and click on the big "+" icon available in the interface.
* Then click on the camera roll icon to select the photo that you want to edit. Alternatively, you can also go to "browse" to select any meme template from the default categories and the trending one available on the Imgur application interface.

## Part 4\. Imgur Alternative for Computer

If for some reason you are unable to use Imgur on your device, or you want to use any other efficient meme generator for creating meme videos, then Filmora is an excellent choice for that.

* Then select the video file or video meme template that you want to edit. Now, [Filmora]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor/) will import it to its interface. You can either select one single file from your camera roll. You can also add multiple images or videos to make a meme.
