**Connect with Others-** LinkedIn profile tips on connecting with others is a crucial one as the recruitment consultants prefer to grasp graduates or even students while the company’s direct recruiters often do not like inexperienced people. Connecting with companies in career fairs and events can be a good idea.

Follow the companies you target.

**Publish Post-** Publishing posts can keep you active in the LinkedIn network and help others to find you out easily. Are you not sure what to post? In order to post on a regular basis, you can create a system where you can share news of some awards or accolades of your company, event announcements, or maybe your own BLOG posts. When you become confident and comfortable, you may start sharing your opinion on any company or industry article or photos, etc.

**Summarize Yourself Wisely-** What should your LinkedIn profile summary contain? 3-5 small paragraphs with some listing skills in the middle. You must share your passions, unique skills and qualifications, and a list of industry exposure you had over the years.
