## Part 1: GoPro Video Editing App for Android

### 1.Quik

This is one of the most convenient and easy to use app in GoPro's arsenal. Quik is a free application that would automatically create nicely edited videos within just a few minute's time. The editing process is as simple as it can possibly get; all you have to do is selecting the videos or pictures which you would like to show in the movie from the library and Quik is going to do the rest. However, you can only use the images and videos which are stored in your phone's library. You can also mix the GoPro footage with those of your phones if you want.

### 2.Antix

Antix is a special kind of application that makes use of the motion sensors of your smartphone in order to detect when some exciting action is happening. However, the app developers still haven’t revealed what exactly is deemed exciting by this app. It would recommend the key scenes by a comparison of the recorded motion footage from your phone with the help of the video stream of your GoPro.

### 3. KineMaster

This video editor is multiple timeline editing. The slow-motion editor can empower the details of your exciting moments, which means viewers can have more engagement with your GoPro videos. The power of this app derives from an algorithm that would help you to find the most exciting snippets from your recordings and edit them promptly into shareable bits. You can also choose to add any background sound to your video wither from the mic of your phone or from a preselected list of licensed tracks.

### 4\. PowerDirector for Android

Comes with loads of features like timeline video editing, cool video effects, slo-mo, a photo-video editor, and lots more. This app is all you need to share cool videos on Vine or YouTube. The footage from your action cam can be edited just like you do it on Magisto or Final Cut. Now you can rotate, trip, split, and even create the coolest slo-mo videos just like GoPro. All you have to do is add the videos for your timeline and start editing.

No matter if you are on the train, on the beach, or hiking in the mountains this cool app would allow you to edit your videos no matter where you are. You can now shoot some amazing moments with your phone and just import the recordings. The video camera app is very useful for quickly deleting unwanted scenes and arranging the clips. You can even manually alter the brightness, colors, and contrasts of the video.

## Part 2: GoPro Video Editing App for iPhone

### 6. Splice

If more precise control is what you are after then you need to go for Splice. This iOS app functions like a regular video editing app that lets the user choose more than a single backing track, allows manual transitions, records voiceover, and even adds filters to the videos and images of the timeline. It goes without saying that Splice is one of the best free and easy to use the iOS app with which you can do your basic GoPro editing.

### 7\. iMovie

Owners of iPhone and iPads are surely familiar with this light and powerful video editor which allows you to professionally edit your GoPro footage no matter where you are. You need to copy the footage to your iOS device and launch the app; now you can select the footage from your ‘Projects’ tab and start editing.

### 8\. GoFix

Though your action camera would allow you to take photos in situations in which most other cameras won't allow, your photos are going to be a bit distorted because of the fisheye effect on GoPro. Though many of us prefer the fisheye look, you can always choose to do away with it by using the GoFix app. With the GoFix app, you no longer need to worry about those curved horizons.
