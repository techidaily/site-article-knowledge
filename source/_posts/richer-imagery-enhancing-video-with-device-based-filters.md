## Part 1 Add filter to video on PC

Here are two ways to add a filter on video:

● You can shoot a video with filter effect directly from a video camera filter which is quite expensive.

● Besides, you can also use a video editor with a built-in filter effect to enhance the cost-effective video performance.

However, an editor for a video filter is easier to get than buying a professional video camera filter, especially when you know video editing. There are many video filter editors on the Internet, but today we will discuss a fully functional video editing software known as a Filmora video editor. It is effortless for a beginner or semi-pro and works on (Windows or Mac) PC. With thousands of unique filters and effects, Filmora can be your one-stop-shop, an answer to how to add aesthetic filters to videos.
