A new user can easily browse the entire player without any trouble. The player can be used to create a video stream.

The downside that is quoted often is that new users find it time-consuming to get familiar with the configuration.

### 5. DivX Plus

In keeping with the tradition of suggesting you a free MKV player, the last on the list is DivX Plus which is somewhat a diva of the media player world.
