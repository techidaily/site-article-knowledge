A new user can easily browse the entire player without any trouble. The player can be used to create a video stream.

 ![5kplayer for mkv files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/5kplayer-for-mkv-files.jpg)

The downside that is quoted often is that new users find it time-consuming to get familiar with the configuration.

### 4. MPlayerX

### 5. DivX Plus

In keeping with the tradition of suggesting you a free MKV player, the last on the list is DivX Plus which is somewhat a diva of the media player world.
