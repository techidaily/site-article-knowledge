### 4\. Taskbar and Start Menu Placements

The biggest Windows 11 tip and trick is the placement of Taskbar and Start Menu. Windows 11 has a taskbar and start menu in the center. The relocation of the taskbar and the start menu can be done easily. By changing the placement, you can make Windows 11 look like Windows 10 if you prefer it that way. For that, open the ‘Taskbar Behavior’ and click on ‘Taskbar Alignment’ and relocate it.

### 5\. Remove Unwanted Ads on Apps

The updated technology allows you to have better control over the privacy of your data and device from personalized ads. For this, go to the ‘Settings’ panel and then move over to the 'Privacy and Security’ section. From the right panel, hit the ‘General’ settings. Now you can select whether you want the apps or websites to show ads based on your interests.

### 7\. Widgets and Chat Customization

Using Widgets and Chats helps the user have a quick chat with people that they love the most. Widget and Chats are the two new features introduced in Windows 11.

However, some people do not like using this kind of stuff. They don’t even prefer crowding their taskbar. For such cases, you can turn them off from the toggle switches that are available in the ‘Show or Hide the buttons that appear on Taskbar' or 'Taskbar Items. '

![disable widgets and other items](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/windows-11-secret-tips-and-tricks-7.jpg)

By default, it is set to 'Balanced.' You are suggested to select the 'Strict' option so that all the harmful trackers are blocked.
