## Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?

Some individuals experience ASMR in response to various sensory "triggers." It may be listening to someone talk or tapping or seeing someone brush their hair or folding their clothing with care and precision. It could also be particular noises like tapping or whispering. In addition, one of the most common triggers in ordinary life is a light touch, such as caressing someone's arm or tracing one's fingers on the back.

Here are some fundamental reasons **why people like ASMR**:

* **ASMR helps one cope with Stress & Anxiety:** Studies fund that ASMR assists people in dealing with stress and anxiety. One [2018 research](https://asmruniversity.com/2018/06/26/asmr-research-survey-affect-physiology/) discovered that ASMR reduced stress, while another in 2017 discovered that 11% of individuals viewed ASMR videos mainly to assist them in coping with anxiety. Similarly, 2015 research found that 70% of its participants utilized ASMR films to cope with stress. It's not just anecdotal evidenceâ€”research reveals that individuals who watch ASMR regularly report feeling happier and less stressed than those who don't!
* **It helps some people solve sleeping issues:** If this is the case, you are not alone. Many individuals use ASMR as a sleep aid by many individuals. According to a [2017 study](https://asmruniversity.com/2017/11/09/asmr-research-survey-personality-empathy-triggers/), 41% of individuals utilized ASMR to help them fall asleep. Another [2015 research](https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/) discovered that 82 percent of the subjects used ASMR to fall asleep because the videos are low-stress and calming. Because they generally center on relaxing sounds or sights, viewing ASMR videos might help you unwind after a busy day and prepare for the night.

## Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?

Another pertinent query relating to the above section would be **why ASMR is relaxing**. Here is a detailed and factual answer.

ASMR is a sense of quiet, relaxation, and comfort from viewing particular videos that often show someone executing a delicate job, such as speaking or tapping on things. These films visibly improve people's tranquillity and help them fall asleep quicker. They also establish a bond between the maker of the video and the viewer. You can trace this behavior back to ancient times when individuals would listen to others tell tales to feel comfortable and at peace.

![why is asmr relaxing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-3.jpg)

Giulia Poerio's Hubbub public engagement work has included her [psychological research](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28427/Bookshelf%5FNBK453230.pdf?sequence=1#page=123) on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). The research stated that relaxing, tingling sensations begin at the top of the head and spread down the neck, spine, and sometimes throughout the rest of the body in response to specific triggers. According to this study, ASMR is fascinating, whether experienced or not. The sheer number of YouTube videos and accompanying viewership data show that it is far from a niche experience. According to anecdotal evidence, you can use ASMR as a sleep aid and a technique for increasing wellness.

People have even employed ASMR to assist them in curing their discomfort. While it requires further research to support this assertion, they conducted a study to keep it. In [2015, an analysis](https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/) indicated that 42 percent of individuals said ASMR helped them cope with chronic pain.

Scientists are still debating how ASMR can reduce chronic pain, although some relate it to the release of endorphins during an ASMR session. Endorphins are substances in the body that may make us happy and diminish our sense of pain. However, there is no authentication to support this idea.

Although they carried out a considerable study on ASMR and its impact on chronic pain, many individuals have found relief utilizing ASMR videos for their condition! If you suffer from chronic pain, try watching these ASMR videos for pleasure or to see if they help relieve your symptoms.

* **Immediate Relief:** When someone experiences the chills and tingles associated with ASMR, we describe it as a delightful and calming sensation that occurs relatively quickly after exposure to the stimulus.
* **The elevated state of mind**: Early research found that after exposure to ASMR, eighty percent of Trusted Source participants experienced an improvement in their mood. People with greater levels of depression had a quicker drop in their benefits.
* **Pain alleviation:** The same research According to Reliable Source, some individuals who suffer from chronic pain had relief that lasted for up to three hours after being exposed to the substance.
* **Greater intensity of focus**: When you're so engrossed in something that you lose track of time and concentrate so intently on it, you're said to be in a "flow state." Researchers have discovered that ASMR and the sort of focused attention you get when you're in the zone, also known as flow, have been commonalities.
* **Better sleep:** ASMR has been found in preliminary studies to have the potential to assist in inducing a state of relaxation. Also, improve brainwave activity, which is necessary for a good night's rest.
* **Other advantages:** People who participate in ASMR activities note improvements in areas such as decreased anxiety, fewer migraines, lower blood pressure, and other health benefits. Although they are consistent with what they tell us, these assertions still need to be supported by more studies.

The best part is that almost anybody can use it. If you think these advantages may benefit you, you can try them. You can find out **if ASMR is good for you** without spending money or a doctor's prescription online.
