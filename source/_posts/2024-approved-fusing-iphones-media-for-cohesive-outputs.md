## Part 2: Combine videos with iMovie

iMovie is one of the apps in the list that can assist you to merge videos on iPhone. You can yourself create beautiful movies with the assistance of iMovie. Once you combine videos on iPhone, this app will let you transfer your videos between various iOS devices via AirDrop or iCloud Drive. Here is how you can add videos together on iPhone via iMovie.

Check more details about [How to Edit Videos on iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Step 1 – Launch iMovie app and get under the “Project” section available on the top of the screen.

Step 2 – Now, tap on “Create Project” and then select the video type out of the two options available, i.e. “Movie” or “Trailer”, select “Movie” in this case. Next, tap on “Create” from the next screen. Or you can import video from File.

Step 3 – Your project interface has now been successfully loaded on your screen. Now, to add the source video file, tap the “Media” icon on the left top of the timeline and your video gallery will load up on your screen. Select the desired source video and tap the “Add” icon to add it on the iMovie’s timeline.

Step 4 – Once your preferred video is added on the timeline, you can scroll the timeline to left or right to let the vertical line known as "playhead’ appear on the screen. Now, place the playhead by scrolling left or right, exactly at the place where you desire to combine the video.

Step 5 – This is the time where you need to add another video which you wish to combine with the source video. Follow the same process mentioned above to get your video added on the timeline. The nearest position to the playhead, be it before the existing video clip or after the clip, will let the fresh clip added to the video.

Step 6 – Now, if you wish to preview the two added videos in a combined playback, simply hit on the “Play” icon available just above the timeline in middle of the screen.

Step 7 – You can also use the transition effects from the presets to apply the desired effect when your first video is switched to another. Or, you can use the traditional fade in or out (default transition) as well.

And, the next interface will bring you up to a screen where you can simply save the merged video file on your local storage or can directly upload them to various cloud storage platforms. Moreover, here on this screen you can give your video a custom defined title too.
