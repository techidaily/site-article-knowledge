## FAQs

#### Q1\. What's the best polar pattern for ASMR microphones?

Having an ASMR microphone with multiple polar patterns is great but if you have the one with just a cardioid polar pattern that's cool. With a cardioid polar pattern mic, you can capture your voice without any background noise. We listed some microphones with only cardioid polar patterns in the article above. Check them out.

#### Q2\. How to choose the best ASMR Microphone?

Selecting the best ASMR microphone isn't easy, but here are some important factors to look out for to make the best decision:

* Affordability
* Polar Pattern
* Sensitivity
* Power source
* Condenser/Dynamic (Condenser is a better option)
