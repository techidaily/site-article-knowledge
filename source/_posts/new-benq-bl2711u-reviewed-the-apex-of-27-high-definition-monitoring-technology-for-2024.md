Earlier, they were focused only on development of E Sports displays and gaming accessories but now company has brought eye catching models of professional monitors into market. They have designed high quality products even with affordable price tag as compared to Asus and Dell. BenQ BL2711U is one of the most popular monitor for professional users, offering outstanding 4K graphics, 60Hz performance on its 27” screen. There are so many unique and impressive things to discuss about BenQ BL2711U; go through the detailed review below to gain complete information about it.

## Design and Features

#### 1.Design Style

 Considering the design of BenQ BL2711U we must say that this monitor is designed to serve users in mild environments like design studios or offices. Manufacturers have not added much bling to this design rather they focused more on minimalistic design that can suit to professional atmosphere. The cabinet was finished with attractive matte black exterior where the grippy, subtle and finger print free texture make it more appealing. The bezels have same appearance as that of the cabinet so you will not observe any distraction for viewing experience on this 27” screen. BenQ BL2711U is finished with a medium range anti glare coating so you can have a reflection free view but it introduces little grainy texture to this monitor.

Lines as well as Wireframes show satisfactory performance and the contrast setting never causes any strain on eyes because it can adjust all pictures to natural appearance. The colours appear vibrant on this screen and you will not find any disturbance in shades. Some users may notice little issue related to blue hue over pictures but thanks to advanced blue light filter that can easily handle this trouble.
