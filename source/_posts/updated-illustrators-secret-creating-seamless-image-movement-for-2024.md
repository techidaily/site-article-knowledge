## Way 1\. Loop A Video on Vimeo Directly

Most online users watch videos on Vimeo directly through the web browser. This is specifically applicable to computer users. If you want Vimeo loop video for any desired video, the steps are simple. You have to make some adjustments and additions to the video URL on the address bar. You should change the URL accurately for looping a video. Here are the steps on how to loop a video on Vimeo directly.

Step 1: On your device, launch the web browser. Open the official website of Vimeo Watch. Play any video of your liking.

![play video vimeo watch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-vimeo-watch.jpg)

Step 2: Now, you need to change the URL of the video you are playing. Here are the changes to make in the address bar.

* Remove everything at the beginning of "vimeo.com". Add ".player" at the beginning of the URL.
* Add "/video/" after "vimeo.com".
* Add "?amp;loop=1:" at the end of the URL.

Therefore, the initial URL of the video was "<https://vimeo.com/754255543>". You have to change it to "player.vimeo.com/video/754255543?amp;loop=1".

Step 3: After making the changes, press Enter key. The same video will play in a loop until you pause the video or close the web browser's tab.
