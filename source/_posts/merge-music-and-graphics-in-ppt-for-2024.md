## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

After the music embeds in your presentation, anyone who opens the presentation can access and play the music inside PowerPoint.

Your song will play within the Click Sequence of your presentation by default.

After inserting music into your presentation, you can then convert your entire presentation into a video and share it with your colleagues.
