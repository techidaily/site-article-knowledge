### 02Advanced Composition

A more advanced approach to photographic mosaics is when the matching is done pixel by pixel and the library images are then placed after much scrutiny. This takes more time than your usual average.

Moza has a pretty easy-to-navigate interface. You can also take photos with its inbuilt camera to fill up the gaps your library isn’t able to provide images for.
